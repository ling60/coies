ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR INTERLOCUTORY REVIEW AND PETITION TO 
APPLY THE COMMISSION’S AMENDED RULES OF PRACTICE 

Petition filed:     July 25, 2016 
Last brief received:   August 3, 2016  

      Lynn Tilton; Patriarch Partners, LLC; Patriarch Partners VII, LLC; Patriarch Partners 
XIV, LLC; and Patriarch Partners XV, LLC (collectively, “Respondents”), petition the 
Commission for interlocutory review of an administrative law judge’s order that the hearing in 
this proceeding begin on October 24, 2016.  Respondents also petition for interlocutory review of 
the law judge’s refusal to seek an extension of the deadline for filing an initial decision (currently 
                                                                        1
set to expire on November 12, 2016) under Commission Rule of Practice 360.   Respondents

    See 17 C.F.R. § 200.360(a)(2).  Respondents style their filing as a “petition directly to the 
Commission” and, “in the alternative,” as a petition for interlocutory review.  Because 
interlocutory review under Rule of Practice 400 “is the exclusive remedy of a hearing officer’s 
ruling prior to Commission consideration of the entire proceeding,” we construe their request 
regarding the hearing date and initial decision deadline as a petition for interlocutory review.  See 
                                                                             (continued…)

further petition for an order that would apply the Commission’s recent amendments to the Rules 
                                     2
of Practice (the “Amended Rules”)  to this proceeding.  The Division of Enforcement (the 
“Division”) opposes Respondents’ petition. 

       Respondents’ petition for interlocutory review is denied.  The law judge’s rulings 
regarding the hearing date and initial decision deadline are not appropriate for immediate 
Commission review.  With respect to the Amended Rules, the Commission has already 
determined how the Amended Rules should apply to pending proceedings.  

                                       I.       Background 

       The Commission instituted this proceeding on March 30, 2015, alleging that Respondents 
                                                                             3
violated the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.        Two days later , 

Respondents   fi led an injunctive action in  federal district court on the ground that, among other 
things, the presiding administrative law judge’s appointment violated the Appointments Clause 
of Article II of the U.S. Constitution.   

       As Respondents pursued their civil suit, this proceeding continued.  Among other things, 
the parties exchanged witness and exhibit lists and expert reports.  The law judge also conducted 
a prehearing conference on May 7, 2015, and scheduled a hearing to begin on October 13, 2015.   

       On June 30, 2015, the district court dismissed Respondents’ civil suit for lack of subject-
matter jurisdiction, concluding that Respondents must first raise their claims through the 
                                                            4
administrative remedial scheme established by Congress.         Respondents appealed to the  c ourt of 
a ppeals  , which stayed the Commission’s administrative proceeding on September 17, 2015, 

while it considered Respondents’ appeal.  The court of appeals affirmed the district court’s 
                                                                                         5
dismissal of Respondents’ suit on June 1, 2016, and ordered that its stay be vacated.       

                                                                         6
       On July 8, 2016, t wo days after the stay was   ultimately lifted,   attorneys from Gibson, 
                                                                                 7

. . . administrative law judge . . . upon its own initiative,” 15 U.S.C. § 78(d)-1(b), we find no 
basis for doing so for the same reasons we find interlocutory review inappropriate.

                                                     3 

the Division jointly proposed that the law judge schedule a hearing date for early December 

2016.  On July 15, 2016, the law judge declined to do so, stating that “a December 2016 hearing 

date [wa]s inconsistent with a timely resolution of this proceeding consistent with 17 C.F.R. § 

201.360” and ordered the parties to propose a hearing date in September 2016.   

        On July 20, 2016, Respondents requested that the law judge reconsider and vacate her 

July 15 order.  Respondents also requested, in the alternative, that the law judge certify her July 

15 order for interlocutory review.  That same day, Respondents also requested that the law judge 

ask the chief administrative law judge to submit a motion to the Commission requesting an 
                                                   8
extension of time for filing an initial decision.     

        Later that day , t he  law judge reschedul ed  the hearing for  October 24, 2016   , but  denied   

Respondents’ request for a December 2016 hearing date.  The law judge explained:   

        This case involves a single individual respondent and four related entities, 

        charged  with  violations  of  Advisers  Act  Sections  206(1),  206(2),  and 
               9                       10
        206(4)   and Rule 206(4)    -8.     More than five months  elapsed from  the 

        institution of this proceeding until the time this proceeding was stayed in 

        September 2015, with the hearing originally schedu          led to commence on 

        October  13,  2015.    Most  of  the  prehearing  steps  had  already  been 

        completed, as noted in the    July 15    Order.     The Second Circuit vacated its 

        stay  order  on  June  1,  2016,  thus  making  the  parties  aware  that  this 

        proceeding would soon continue      .  

        Respondents’  hiring  new  counsel  and  intent  to  file  a  large  number  of 
        prehearing motions are not an adequate basis for substantial delay.  It is 
        also  unnecessary  for  Respondents  to  file  numerous  motions  simply  to 
        preserve issues, such as constitutional issues, for appeal; they may simply 
        note such objections for the record.  As to Respondents’ concerns about 

                                                 
(…continued) 

stay until July 6, 2016, to permit Tilton to file a motion seeking a stay from the Supreme Court.”  
Respondents declined to file such a motion, and the stay expired on July 6, 2016. 
7
     Attorneys from   Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom         LLP  noticed their withdrawal on the 
same day.  Attorneys from Brune Law P.C. noticed their appearance as Respondent             s’ counsel on 
April 13, 2015, and have remained Respondents’ counsel of record since that date.

       including use of subpoenas,  to  compel attendance  of witnesses,  or can 
       make arrangements for expert witnesses to appear by video conference if 
       necessary.   

The law judge also declined to certify her July 15 order for interlocutory review, finding that 
Respondents’ request “patently fails to meet the standards of 17 C.F.R. § 201.400(c) and must be 
denied.”  Finally, the law judge did not grant their request for an extension of the initial decision 
deadline and did not certify that ruling for interlocutory review. 

                                       II.      Analysis 

A.     Respondents’ petition does not raise issues appropriate for interlocutory review. 

       The Commission’s “emphatic preference—which embodies the ‘general rule’ disfavoring 
piecemeal, interlocutory appeals—is that claims should be presented in a single petition for 
review after ‘the entire record [has been] developed’ and ‘after issuance by the law judge of an 
                 11
initial decision.’”   A party’s disagreement with a law judge’s determination “does not make a 
                                              12
ruling ‘appropriate for interlocutory review.’”   Interlocutory review is appropriate “only in a 
truly unusual case, where serious and prejudicial error [is] plainly apparent upon even a cursory 
review of the record, and where deferring review until issuance of an initial decision might well 
                                                  13
postpone an inevitable later vacatur and remand.”   Indeed, Rule 400 provides that petitions for 
interlocutory review are “disfavored” and will be granted only in “extraordinary circumstances” 
                                                                                 14
to “make clear that petitions for interlocutory review . . . rarely will be granted.”   We do not 
find such extraordinary circumstances to be present here. 

       The law judge decided to set the hearing for October 2016 rather than December 2016 
                                                                15
and did not request an extension of the initial decision deadline.  Setting a hearing date and 
deciding whether to seek an extension of time to file an initial decision fits  squarely within the 
                                                                                             16
law judge’s authority under Rule of Practice 111 to “regulat[e] the course of a proceeding.”

                                                 5 

That rule is “‘broadly worded’ to accommodate a law judge’s discretion to manage a case plan 
                                                                   17
within the limits of our Rules of Practice and governing statutes.”   The Commission has 
repeatedly emphasized that it will not grant petitions for interlocutory review of such “fact-
                                          18
bound, discretionary procedural rulings.”   Moreover, the law judge’s decisions about when to 
hold the hearing and whether to request an extension of time in which to issue an initial decision 
involve quintessentially mixed questions of law and fact that are inappropriate for interlocutory 
       19
review.    

       These decisions also do not satisfy the standards for obtaining certification of a ruling for 
interlocutory review from the law judge —that (1) the ruling “involves controlling questions of 
law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion” and (2) an “immediate 
                                                                             20
review of the order may materially advance completion of the proceeding.”  As the law judge 
recognized, the rulings that Respondents seek to challenge “fail[] to meet the[se]

standards.”   And “issues that do not satisfy Rule 400(c) will almost never be appropriate for 
                                                 22
interlocutory consideration by the Commission.”  

       Respondents argue that interlocutory review is appropriate because the present hearing 
schedule denies them “the opportunity to fully and fairly litigate their defense” and violates their 
“right to counsel of [their] choice by effectively punishing Respondents for changing counsel 
recently.”  But the Supreme Court has made clear that “only an unreasoning and arbitrary 
‘insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay’ violates the right to 
                          23
the assistance of counsel.”   This is not a case in which there are “extraordinary circumstances” 
warranting postponement, such as when respondents are left without assistance of counsel at or 
                                                   24
near the hearing date through no fault of their own.   Although Respondents recently   replaced 

                                                  
21
    We  do not believe that granting interlocutory review will materially advance completion of 
the proceeding.  To the contrary, immediate Commission review of the law judge’s pre-hearing 
decisions is more likely to delay the proceedings further.  If the law judge’s pre-hearing 
decisions are later determined to be incorrect, those decisions can “‘be effectively reviewed post-
judgment’” by vacatur and remand.  Nat. Blue Res., 2015 WL 470453, at *4 (quoting Dearlove, 
2006 SEC LEXIS 3191, at *6 n.7) (finding that review of law judge’s refusal to postpone hearing 
date was likely to delay proceeding further and could be effectively reviewed on appeal); accord

throughout this proceeding.   

       Nor are we persuaded by Respondents’ claim that their new counsel will have insufficient 
time to review what they describe as a voluminous and complex record.  When the court of 
appeals initially stayed this proceeding, the hearing was set to begin in three weeks and, as the 
Division notes, many phases of the proceeding had been completed, including the exchange of 
witness and exhibit lists and expert reports.  Once the court of appeals lifted that stay on July 6, 
the law judge essentially granted the parties an additional 13 weeks in which to prepare by 
                                         25
rescheduling the hearing for October 24.     T he Commission  has  consistently declined to grant 
interlocutory review based on similar claim s of  insufficient time to review large or complex 
        26
records.    Moreover , Respondents’ claims about their alleged inability to prepare adequately, the 
Division’s alleged failure to produce documents and information, and key witnesses’ alleged

continuance and adherence to the previously scheduled hearing date where applicants were given

unavailability are, at this point, too speculative to interrupt the proceedings and order immediate 
       27
review.   

B.     The Commission has specified how the Amended Rules apply to pending 
       proceedings. 

       The Commission has already considered how the Amended Rules should apply to 
pending proceedings, and many of the Amended Rules will apply to this proceeding.  For 
example, in adopting the Amended Rules, the Commission concluded that it would be “just and 
practicable” for the amendments to Rules 180 (Sanctions), 232 (Subpoenas), 235 (Prior Sworn 
Statements), and 320 (Evidence Admissibility) to apply to proceedings where, as here, the 
                                                                         28
hearing will begin after the effective date (which is September 27, 2016).    The Commission 
similarly concluded that rules concerning appellate procedure (e.g., Rule 410) will apply to 
                                                            29
appeals filed on or after the Amended Rules’ effective date.    

       Nonetheless, Respondents request that the Commission order that the Amended Rules 
concerning the timing of proceedings, depositions and expert discovery, and dispositive motions 
also apply to this proceeding.  The Commission has already determined that this is not “just and 
            30
practicable.”   The Amended Rules apply to pending proceedings “depending on the stage of the 
            31
proceeding.”   This is a case that was stayed on the eve of a final hearing, after discovery had 
virtually been completed and the parties had made pre-trial disclosures of witness lists and expert 
reports.  Applying these Amended Rules to such a case—which would, among other things, 
entail the parties’ conducting depositions—runs counter to the Commission’s determination that 
for cases in a sufficiently advanced posture, application of these Amended Rules would delay 
                                                      32
resolution and “unduly disrupt pending proceedings.”   Respondents provide no compelling 
reasons why we should treat their case uniquely from all the other pending cases in our 
administrative tribunals, and deviate from our decision that the availability of the Amended 
Rules for litigants in pending proceedings should depend on the stage of their proceeding.

    See, e.g., Midwestern Gas Transmission Co. v. FERC, 589 F.2d 603, 622 (D.C. Cir. 1978) 
(finding that parties’ “alleged injury falls far short of what is required to overcome the Court’s 
interest in denying consideration until the issues are more sharply defined”).  We note, however, 
that such issues rarely, if ever, would be appropriate for interlocutory review by the Commission.

       Accordingly, it is ORDERED that Respondents’ petition for an order extending the time 
for the law judge to file an initial decision in this proceeding and setting a December 2016 
hearing date; for interlocutory review of the law judge’s July 15 and July 20 Orders; and for an 
order applying recent amendments to the Rules of Practice to this proceeding is denied.
