SciClone Charged With FCPA Violations 
 
Feb 4, 2016 - The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that California-based 
SciClone Pharmaceuticals has agreed to pay more than $12 million to settle charges that it 
violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when international subsidiaries increased 
sales by making improper payments to health care professionals employed   at state health 
institutions in China.   
 
An SEC investigation found that employees of SciClones subsidiaries acted as agents of the 
company when they gave money, gifts, and other things of value to the health care professionals , 
which led to several million dollars in sales of pharmaceutical products to Chinas state health 
institutions.  The schemes, which lasted at least five years, were condoned by various managers 
within SciClones China-based subsidiaries.  The improper inducements were not accurately 
reflected in the companys books and records  as SciClone failed to devise and maintain a 
sufficient system of internal accounting controls and lacked an effective anti-corruption 
compliance program. 
 
The SECs order finds that SciClone violated the FCPAs anti-bribery, internal controls, and 
books-and-records provisions.  SciClone consented to the order without admitting or denying the 
findings, and agreed to pay $9.426 million in disgorgement of sales profits plus $900,000 in 
prejudgment interest and a $2.5 million penalty.  SciClone agreed to give status reports to the 
SEC for the next three years on its remediation and implementation of anti-corruption 
compliance measures. 
 
The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice and 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
