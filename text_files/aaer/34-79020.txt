                                            I. 

      The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to 
Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against Dennis Duban 
(“Respondent” or “Duban”).  The Commission also deems it appropriate to issue an order of 
forthwith suspension of Respondent pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of 
                                 1

                                           II. 

      In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the

      Rule 102(e)(2) provides in pertinent part:  “Any… person who has been convicted of a felony or a 
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude shall be forthwith suspended from appearing or practicing before the

Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commission’s 
jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the findings contained in 
Section III.5. below, and consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings 
Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Adviser Act of 1940 and Rule 102(e)(2) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), 
as set forth below.   

                                               III. 

       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  

       1.      Respondent became licensed as a Certified Public Accountant (“CPA”) in California 
in 1976, in Washington in 1993, in Hawaii in 1999, and in New York in 2001. 

       2.      From October 2006 through March 2012, Respondent operated Dennis L. Duban, 
CPA, a state-registered advisory firm, as a sole proprietor.   

       3.      On September 15, 2010, Duban was charged with two counts of conspiracy to 
defraud in violation of Title 18 United States Code, Section 371 and three counts of violating Title 
26 United States Code, Section 7206(2) in a criminal action entitled United States v. Dennis 
Lawrence Duban, 10-CR-631 (LEK) before the United States District Court for the District of 
Hawaii. 

       4.      On February 7, 2011, and May 26, 2011, Respondent, as Chief Compliance Officer 
for Dennis L. Duban, CPA, falsely certified that neither Dennis L. Duban, CPA, nor its advisory 
affiliates had been charged with any felony in the past ten years in its Form ADVs.  An “advisory 
affiliate” includes an investment adviser’s non-clerical employees, its officers, partners, and 
directors, and persons controlling or controlled by the adviser.   

       5.      On October 1, 2012, Respondent pleaded guilty in U.S. v. Duban to one count of 
conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service in violation of Title 18 United States Code, 
Section 371, and one count of willfully aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false personal 
income tax return in violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7206(2).  On June 3, 2014, 
the court entered judgment against Duban, sentencing him to a prison term of two years followed by 
three years of supervised release.  He was also fined $30,000 and ordered to pay a $200 special 
assessment.   

       6.      In his plea agreement, Duban admitted inter alia, that he provided accounting and 
tax planning services to Individual A, Individual B, and Company C; that he did not report as 
income on Individual A’s individual tax return certain payments for personal expenses made on 
Individual A’s behalf by Company C; and that he underreported the gain on sale of property on 
Individual B’s personal tax return.  Duban admitted that these tax returns were materially false and 
his actions in preparing them were willful and knowing.   

       7.      Duban’s Washington CPA license lapsed in 2013.  He surrendered or forfeited his 
Hawaii CPA license in 2013 due to disciplinary action.  In December 2014, Duban’s application to 

                                                2

surrender his New York CPA license was granted.  Duban surrendered his California CPA license 
via stipulated settlement effective January 1, 2015.   

                                                IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanctions agreed to in Duban’s Offer. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, that 
Duban be, and hereby is barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, 
municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent;  

       Any reapplication for association by the Respondent will be subject to the applicable laws 
and regulations governing the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned upon a number of 
factors, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of any or all of the following:  (a) any 
disgorgement ordered against the Respondent, whether or not the Commission has fully or partially 
waived payment of such disgorgement; (b) any arbitration award related to the conduct that served 
as the basis for the Commission order; (c) any self-regulatory organization arbitration award to a 
customer, whether or not related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission order; 
and (d) any restitution order by a self-regulatory organization, whether or not related to the conduct 
that served as the basis for the Commission order. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Duban has been convicted of a felony 
within the meaning of Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 

       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, that Dennis Duban is forthwith suspended from 
appearing or practicing before the Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice.   

       By the Commission.
