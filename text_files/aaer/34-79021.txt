                                             I. 

       The Securities and Exchange Commission deems it appropriate  to issue an order of 
forthwith suspension of Steven M. Brazile pursuant to Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission’s Rules 
                                     1

                                            II. 

       The Commission finds that:  

       1.     Brazile maintained a certified public accountant license from the state of Texas 
beginning in March 1991 until March 2013, when his license expired.  In September 2014, 
Brazile surrendered his certificate for revocation in lieu of further disciplinary action.   

       2.     On July 30, 2013, Brazile pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of Illinois to one count of interstate transportation of a security obtained by 
fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 2314 in United States v. Steven M. Brazile, 13-CR-560.   

       3.     On November 13, 2013, Brazile was sentenced to 48 months imprisonment, 
followed by three years of supervised release.  The Court ordered Brazile to make full restitution 
of $3,902,880.85 and to pay an assessment.  In addition, the Court entered a forfeiture order 
against him.

       Rule 102(e)(2) provides in pertinent part:  “Any ... person who has been convicted of a felony or a 
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude shall be forthwith suspended from appearing or practicing before the 
Commission.”
