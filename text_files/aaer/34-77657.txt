        The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Laura P. 
Messenbaugh (“Respondent” or “Messenbaugh”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the 
                                  1

                                               II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent 
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions 
(“Order”), as set forth below.   
 
                                               III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
               1.     Messenbaugh, age 51, is and has been a certified public accountant licensed 
to practice in the State of Washington.  She served as Chief Accounting Officer and Vice President 
of Finance and Accounting of SMF Energy Corp. (“SMF”) from approximately 2007 until at least 
March 2012. 
        
               2.     SMF was, at all relevant times, a publicly-held Delaware corporation, 
headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, whose primary businesses were commercial mobile-
fueling and lubricant distribution.  At all relevant times, SMF’s common stock was registered with 
the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange 
Act”) and traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “FUEL”. 
 
               3.     On April 6, 2016, by consent, a Final Judgment was entered against 
Messenbaugh, permanently enjoining her from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities 
Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder; and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 
thereunder, in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Laura P. 
Messenbaugh, et al., Civil Action Number 15-62028-CIV in the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of Florida.  Messenbaugh was also barred from serving as an officer or 
director; ordered to pay disgorgement of $11,010 and $1,408 of prejudgment interest thereon; and 
ordered to pay a $60,000 civil money penalty. 
 
               4.      The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that 
Messenbaugh, and the other defendants, participated in a fraudulent billing scheme involving SMF.  
The Commission further alleged that from approximately June 2010 through mid-March 2012 this 
scheme misled investors by materially overstating SMF’s financial performance and falsely 
attributing SMF’s purported improved financial results to legitimate business factors, while not 
disclosing that in reality the purported improvement in its financial results was due to the 
fraudulent billing scheme.  Additionally, the Commission alleged that this scheme caused SMF to 

                                                2

provide financial statements to the investing public that were not in compliance with Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles, and that Messenbaugh and other provided false information to 
SMF’s independent auditors.      
 
                                               IV. 
                                                  
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Messenbaugh’s Offer. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that: 
 
       Messenbaugh is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an 
accountant.  
 
       By the Commission.
