B. SUMMARY 
 
       This matter involves financial reporting fraud in connection with Huntington’s financial 
statements included in the annual reports the Bank filed with the Commission for fiscal years 2001 
and 2002 in violation of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.3
                                                                           In both years, 
Huntington reported inflated earnings in its financial statements, enabling the Bank to meet or exceed 
Wall Street analyst earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations and to meet internal EPS targets (“Target  
EPS”) that determined the bonuses of senior management.  Using improper accounting that was 
qualitatively material, Huntington  overstated 2001 operating earnings by $8.5 million ($.04 per share) 
and 2002 operating earnings by $17.1 million ($.08 per share).  Without the misstatements, 
Huntington’s earnings would have fallen short of analyst operating earnings expectations in both years 
and in 2002 bonuses for Hoaglin and McMennamin, the Bank’s CEO and CFO, respectively, would 
have been eliminated and the bonus for Van Fleet, the Bank’s controller, would have been reduced.  In 
2001 and 2002, Huntington offered and sold securities pursuant to Forms S-3 and S-8 registration 
statements filed with the Commission under the Securities Act.  The registration statements 
incorporated by reference materially misleading reports filed under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act 
and Rule 13a-1 thereunder containing the above-described overstatements of earnings. 
        
       Beginning in August 2002 and continuing through January 15, 2003, Huntington conducted 
seven due diligence meetings for the purpose of addressing financial reporting and accounting issues 
relevant to the certification of financial statements by Hoaglin and McMennamin, as required by the 
Commission under its order dated June 27, 2002 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”), 15 
U.S.C. §§ 7201 et seq.  The Act required Hoaglin and McMennamin, the Bank’s signing officers, to 
each certify that he had reviewed the financial reports at issue and that the statements of material fact 
contained therein were true, that no statement of material fact  had been omitted, and that, based on 
such officer’s knowledge, the financial statements and other financial information included in the 
report fairly presented in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of 
Huntington.  Van Fleet, in consultation with outside counsel, initiated this due diligence process. 
        
       On or about March 20, 2003, following the due diligence meetings, Hoaglin and 
McMennamin signed and certified Huntington’s 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the 
provisions of the Act. At that time, Hoaglin and McMennamin signed and certified the 2002         
Form 10-K, which contained untrue statements of material fact and omitted to state material facts  
necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements 
were made, not misleading. 
        
       In connection with the 2001 and 2002 annual reports filed with the Commission and  
disseminated to the public, Huntington engaged in improper accounting practices, enabling it to 
meet or exceed analysts’ expectations and to pay incentive based                                         bonuses.  Those practices included  
up front recognition of loan and lease origination fees that were required by accounting rules to be 
deferred and amortized over the term of the loan or lease; improper capitalization of commission  
expenses and deferral of pension costs which were required to be recognized in the period incurred; 
misstated reserves; improper deferral of income; and misclassification of non-operating income as 
operating income.  As a result of its accounting misstatements, Huntington overstated 2001

operating earnings of $293.5 million by $8.5 million ($.04 per share) and 2002 operating earnings of  
$328.5 by $17.1 million ($.08 per share).  Had it not been for the                                   accounting misstatements, 
Huntington’s reported operating EPS for 2001 and 2002 would have been                    $1.13 and $1.27, 
respectively, short of Wall Street analyst expectations and senior               management’s EPS bonus targets, 
instead of the $1.17 operating EPS it actually reported for 2001 and the $1.35 operating EPS reported 
for 2002. 
        
       As a consequence of these actions, Huntington violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of 
the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 
12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  With respect to fiscal year 2002, Hoaglin, as Chief Executive 
Officer,  caused Huntington’s violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Sections 
13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder and 
directly violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.  McMennamin and Van Fleet violated Sections 
17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2­
1 thereunder, and caused  Huntington’s violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of 
the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, and McMennamin directly violated 
Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.  
 
C. FACTS 
 
       1.     Overview of Accounting Principles  

       The SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 (“SAB 99”), issued in August 1999, states 
that qualitative factors may cause a misstatement of an item in a financial statement of a 
quantitatively small amount to be material, including, particularly relevant to Huntington, 
whether the misstatement hides a failure to meet analysts’ consensus expectations and whether 
the misstatement has the effect of increasing management’s compensation by satisfying 
requirements for the award of bonuses or other forms of incentive compensation. 
 
       During 2001 and 2002, Huntington failed to account for fees received in connection with 
the origination of automobile lease financing and loans, in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles (“GAAP”), as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring 
Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases (“FAS 91”).  FAS 91 requires that “[l]oan origination 
fees shall be deferred and recognized over the life of the loan as an adjustment of yield (interest 
income)” unless the difference between this method and an alternative accounting treatment is 
not material.  Contrary to this requirement, beginning in 1997, with the concurrence of its outside 
auditors, Huntington recognized all such fees as income in the period received. 
       During 2001 and 2002, Huntington also improperly deferred, rather than expensed, sales 
commissions paid to Bank employees for obtaining certain new deposit accounts.  Under GAAP, 
as stated in ¶ 86b of Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5, Recognition and 
Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises, “[m]any expenses, such as selling 
and administrative salaries, are recognized during the period in which cash is spent or liabilities 
are incurred for goods and services that are used up either simultaneously with acquisition or 
soon after.”  Huntington began this practice in 1997, with the concurrence of its outside auditors. 

                                          - 4 -

---------------------Page 5---------------------

       In 2002, Huntington changed its method of accounting for pension settlement costs from  
immediately expensing the cost in the period incurred to deferring the cost and amortizing it over 
approximately eight years.  This accounting change was not disclosed in the Bank’s financial 
statements.  Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 20, states: 
               The Board concludes that in the preparation of financial statements 
               there is a presumption that an  accounting principle once adopted   
               should not be changed in accounting  for events and transactions of 
               a similar type. Consistent use of   accounting principles from one   
               accounting period to another enhan     ces the utility of financial 
               statements to users by facilitating analysis and understanding of 
               comparative accounting data ... the    presumption that an entity 
               should not change an accounting  principle may be overcome only 
               if the enterprise justifies the use of an alternative acceptable     
               accounting principle on the basis that  it is preferable ... the nature 
               of and justification for a change   in accounting principle and its 
               effect on income should be disclosed in the financial statements of 
               the period in which the change is made.  The justification for the 
               change should explain clearly why the newly adopted accounting   
               principle is preferable. 
                
Huntington did not justify or explain why its newly adopted accounting method for pension 
settlement costs was preferable in its 2002 financial statements.  
       Huntington historically maintained a “leakage reserve” in its financial statements to cover 
uninsured losses incurred when the decline in value of leased  automobiles at lease expiration 
exceeded expectations.  For the first time, at year-end 2002, the Bank discounted the reserve 
under a present value concept, in violation of GAAP.  FAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, 
contains the relevant standards for accruing probable losses, such as Huntington’s leakage 
reserve.  FAS 5 requires that, “[a]n estimated loss from a loss contingency … shall be accrued by 
a charge to income” if it is probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of loss can 
be reasonably estimated.  FAS 5 does not permit present value techniques to be used to estimate 
the range of loss. 
 
         2.   The Management Incentive Plan  
          
         Huntington’s compensation of its senior management personnel included a bonus 
component calculated in accordance with its Management Incentive Plan (the  “Plan”).  Prior to 2001, 
Huntington’s senior officer bonuses were determined by corporate performance as measured by return 
on shareholder equity.  In 2001, the Compensation Committee, based on Hoaglin’s                         
recommendation, changed the Plan for Group 1 participants to a single benchmark: EPS.  In 2001,                                                                  
under the Plan, bonuses were triggered if specific EPS targets were met:  EPS of $1.15 for the 
minimum bonus, $1.18 for the target bonus, and $1.25 or above for the maximum bonus (with 
differing amounts due at each cent of differential earnings within those ranges).  Although 
Hoaglin was a Group 1 participant in 2001, under his employment contract he was guaranteed a    
minimum bonus of $420,000 for that year.  In  2001, while other performance based factors also 
affected  the bonuses of McMennamin and Van Fleet, 75% of McMennamin’s bonus and 25% of 
Van Fleet’s bonus were based on the EPS targets. 

                                           - 5 -

---------------------Page 6---------------------

          
         In 2002, Group 1 bonuses were based entirely on meeting EPS targets:  EPS of $1.32 
for the minimum bonus, $1.35 for the target bonus, and $1.40 or above for the maximum bonus 
(again, with differing amounts due at each cent of differential earnings within those ranges).  
That year, bonuses for Hoaglin and McMennamin were based entirely on the EPS targets and 
40% of Van Fleet’s bonus was based on the EPS targets. 
 
       Under the Plan, Huntington’s Compensation Committee could reduce or eliminate an 
award in light of “extraordinary events,” including asset write-downs; litigation or claim 
judgments or settlements; the effect of changes in the law, accounting principles or other 
provisions affecting reported results; accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs; 
capital gains and losses; special charges in connection with mergers and acquisitions; and any 
extraordinary, non-recurring items as described in APB No. 30.  In 2001, the Compensation 
Committee based the EPS component of management bonuses on Huntington’s operating EPS, 
excluding approximately $115 million of restructuring and special charges and $14 million in 
losses from the sale of the Bank’s Florida operations from the bonus computations.  In 2002, 
according to a memorandum from Hoaglin dated March 29, 2002 summarizing the plan for 
beneficiaries, “any special charges or significant accounting rule changes that occur in 2002, will 
neither benefit nor negatively effect the [EPS] calculation under this plan….”  In 2002, the 
Compensation Committee again based the EPS aspect of management bonuses strictly on the 
Bank’s operating EPS, excluding approximately $73 million in gains (realized from the sale of 
Florida operations and Huntington’s merchant services business) and approximately $38 million 
in losses (recorded for restructuring and special charges) from the bonus computations. 
       3.     Huntington’s Earnings Guidance to the Public   
        
       In both 2001 and 2002, Huntington released predictions to analysts and the public for 
expected “operating earnings” for the year.  The guidance was reviewed and revised in quarterly 
earnings announcements and analyst calls.  Based in part on these predictions, Wall Street 
analysts estimated what they believed would be Huntington’s operating EPS.  The average of the 
estimates of the analysts was commonly referred to as the “consensus estimate.”  In July 2001, 
after Hoaglin became CEO, Huntington estimated operating EPS of $1.15 to $1.17 for the 2001 
year.  The analyst consensus operating EPS estimate for 2001 was $1.17 per share.  In a January 
2002 press release, Huntington announced it anticipated 2002 EPS of $1.32 to $1.36 per share. In 
April 2002 and again in July 2002, Hoaglin told the public that he was comfortable with the 
previous guidance.  On October 17, 2002, in discussing Huntington’s quarterly numbers on a 
conference call, Hoaglin said that Huntington expected EPS of $.34 to $.35 for the fourth 
quarter.  The analyst consensus estimate for the fourth quarter was $.35 per share and $1.33 for 
the full year 2002. 
        
       4.     Huntington's 2001 Form 10-K   

       Pursuant to FAS 91, the Bank was required to recognize loan and lease origination fees 
and costs over the life of the loan or lease unless the difference between this method and an 
alternative method was not material.  Despite the materiality of the difference in method, the 
Bank recognized the fees as income in the period received and deferred the associated costs.  In 

                                          - 6 -

---------------------Page 7---------------------

1997, before Hoaglin and McMennamin joined the Bank and before Van Fleet became controller 
at the Bank, Huntington changed its historical practice, which complied with FAS 91, and began 
recognizing origination fees as income entirely in the period received while deferring the related 
costs paid to automobile dealers for placing leases with Huntington.  Huntington continued its 
improper non-GAAP accounting for loan and lease origination fees and costs in 2001 and 2002.   
       Huntington’s disclosure of its accounting policy for origination costs and fees in its 2001 
Form 10-K at Note 1 to the financial statements stated “[n]et direct loan origination costs/fees, 
when material, are deferred and amortized over the term of the loan as a yield adjustment.”  
However, until August 2002, Huntington failed to determine whether the difference between its 
changed accounting treatment of loan and lease origination fees and the treatment required under 
FAS 91 was material, and deferred no loan origination fees at all in 2002. 
         Beginning about 1997, Huntington also changed its historical practice of expensing 
sales commissions paid to employees for originating deposit accounts in the year paid, and began 
amortizing them over the expected life of the accounts.  Although not specifically addressed in 
the accounting pronouncements, it is a generally accepted accounting practice to expense sales 
commissions in the period paid.  Huntington continued this improper non-GAAP practice in 
2001 and 2002. 
 
       Huntington learned in the fourth quarter of 2001 that it had a gain resulting from an 
increase in the cash surrender value of certain bank owned insurance life insurance (“BOLI”) on 
the lives of key bank officers, of which the Bank was beneficiary.  In November 2001, 
McMennamin recommended to Hoaglin that, rather than recognizing the gain in that period, 
Huntington “save it” for 2002, because Huntington would meet the street earnings consensus 
EPS estimates in 2001 without the gain.  Accordingly, Huntington improperly postponed 
recognition of the 2001 gain to 2002.  This accounting item was never discussed or reviewed at 
any of the 2002 due diligence meetings. 
 
       5.      Impact of 2001 Accounting Misstatements on Operating Earnings and EPS  

       Huntington’s 2001 accounting misstatements increased its operating earnings in 2001 and 
enabled it to meet analyst consensus estimates of $1.17 per share.  The extent of the 
misstatements on earnings and EPS is set forth in the table below: 
 

           Year                                                Amount (in   Operating 
                                                               thousands)   EPS

                  Actual operating earnings                    $284,975     $1.13 

  

       6.     The 2002 Earnings Initiative  

       McMennamin prepared Full Year Forecasts (“FYF”) to track operating earnings and EPS.  
The FYF prepared for January 2002 revealed that earnings were anticipated to be materially less 
than the guidance Hoaglin and McMennamin had given analysts.  McMennamin prepared a 
memorandum dated March 17, 2002, entitled “2002 Earnings Initiative,” summarizing the 
earnings to date and the projections for the rest of 2002.  The memorandum made clear that first 
quarter EPS of $.28, was short of the $.31 EPS guidance previously given to analysts and that 
substantial additional initiatives would be needed  in order to meet analyst earnings expectations 
for the year.  McMennamin recommended to Hoaglin that the Bank revise its earnings guidance 
to disclose the lower than projected earnings.  Thereafter, the Bank made a series of accounting 
adjustments, eliminating the forecast of earnings shortfall and allowing Huntington to report to 
investors and analysts that first quarter operating EPS were $.31 as projected. 
 
       7.     The 2002 CEO/CFO Certification Due Diligence Meetings  

       On July 26, 2002, Huntington’s outside counsel sent a memorandum to Hoaglin, 
McMennamin, Van Fleet, and other Huntington executives, addressing the certification 
requirements ordered by the SEC in June 2002.  The memorandum lays out the materiality 
requirements specified by SAB 99 and states that to determine materiality of an accounting 
misstatement or omission required the Bank to consider qualitative factors, including whether the 
impact of the accounting misstatements or omissions affected executive compensation or hid a 
failure to meet analyst consensus expectations.  
       On August 4, 2002, senior executives from Huntington began a series of “due diligence” 
meetings in anticipation of the signing and filing of the certifications by Hoaglin and 
McMennamin, as the Bank’s CEO and CFO, respectively.  McMennamin, Van Fleet, and senior 
members of Huntington’s legal department attended the August 4, 2002 meeting as did the 
Bank’s outside audit senior manager and Huntington’s outside counsel.  The senior executives in 
attendance were cognizant of the qualitative as well as quantitative standards for determining 
materiality, as described in the memorandum from outside counsel dated July 26, 2002.  The 
consensus was that the only possibly relevant SAB 99 qualitative materiality factor was whether 
the item under consideration concerned a segment or other portion of business that had been 
identified as playing a significant role in the Bank’s operations or profitability as it related to the 
potential impact of FAS 91 on the accounting treatment of loan and lease acquisition fees. 
       An additional due diligence meeting was held on August 8, 2002 to follow up on the FAS 
91 issues.  The senior managers, executives and others in attendance, including the Bank’s 
outside audit engagement partner, decided that the FAS 91 issues, including the issue related to 
deposit commissions, were not material either individually or in the aggregate.  Additional due 
diligence meetings were held on August 12, and then in October 2002, November 2002, and 

                                          - 8 -

January 2003.  Each of the aforementioned accounting misstatements made by Huntington that 
had the effect of overstating operating earnings, other than its failure to properly recognize the 
gain on the increase in the value of BOLI in 2001 rather than 2002, was discussed at the due 
diligence meetings.  In the final due diligence meeting held on January 15, 2003, which Hoaglin, 
McMennamin, Van Fleet, senior members of Huntington’s legal department, and the Bank’s 
outside auditor all attended, the group reviewed each of the accounting misstatements (other than 
BOLI) and decided that none of the items was material.  However, the senior executives of the 
Bank failed to follow the procedures for determining materiality under SAB 99 provided by 
Huntington’s outside counsel.  At the time of their participation in the due diligence meetings, 
Hoaglin, McMennamin, and Van Fleet  all knew or should have known the impact the accounting 
misstatements had on bonuses and the Bank’s ability to meet analyst expectations. 
        
       8.      Huntington’s 2002 Form 10-K  
        
       In 2002, the Bank continued the non-GAAP accounting practice of recording as income  
in the period received the entire amount of loan and lease origination fees and deferring the costs 
associated with those fees.  In 2002, Huntington continued its non-GAAP accounting practice of   
capitalizing and amortizing the costs of deposit commissions rather than expensing the costs in 
the period paid.   Huntington also improperly recognized as income in 2002 the gain resulting 
from the increase in the cash surrender value of BOLI that the Bank had realized in 2001.   
 
       In October 2002, Huntingon’s pension actuary advised Van Fleet that there would be a 
pension settlement loss of $3.4 million.  After conferring with the Bank’s outside auditors, who 
concluded that the change was not inappropriate and was not sufficiently material to require 
disclosure, McMennamin and Van Fleet  changed the Bank’s accounting method from expensing 
the loss in the period incurred to deferring the loss and amortizing it against income over eight 
years, thereby increasing Huntington’s 2002 reported after-tax earnings by $2.2 million, or one 
cent per share.  Even though qualitatively material, the accounting change was not disclosed in 
Huntington’s 2002 financial statements as required by GAAP.  Huntington failed to apply its 
accounting policy for pension settlement costs consistently from year to year and failed to 
disclose in its financial statements, as required by APB No. 20, the nature of and justification for 
its change in accounting principle, and the effect on income. 
 
       Just before Huntington’s books were closed on January 4, 2003, they reflected operating 
EPS of $1.338, short of Huntington’s internal operating EPS target of $1.35.  That same day, 
Van Fleet directed the Assistant Controller to release $2.2 million from a previously analyzed 
restructuring                 reserve ($1.4 million on an after tax basis), thereby increasing earnings per share by 
$.008 and boosting full year operating earnings per share to $1.346.  That number was rounded 
up to $1.35, precisely the target operating EPS.  Although the amount of the reduction in the 
reserve may have been appropriate, Huntington improperly reported the $2.2 million reserve 
reversal as operating income in its financial statements even though the reserves established in 
2001 and 2002 had been recorded as non-operating special charges.  The misclassification 
allowed Huntington to meet its target EPS of $1.35 per share and materially affected senior 
management bonuses.

---------------------Page 10---------------------

       Each quarter, Huntington and its risk management group estimated a “leakage reserve” to 
cover uninsured losses incurred when the decline in value of leased automobiles at lease 
expiration exceeded the insured value.  Historically, the reserve was set within the range 
estimated by the Bank’s risk management group.  On January 6, 2003, Huntington’s risk 
management group completed its analysis of the reserve, estimating it to range from $22.9 to 
$33.26 million.  Setting the reserve at $22.9 million, the low end of that range, would have 
required Huntington to record an expense of $2.7 million (the difference between the $22.9 
million and the then balance on the books of $20.2 million), which would have reduced 
Huntington’s operating earnings on an after tax basis by $1.8 million, or one cent per share.  Van 
Fleet was advised that on a present value basis the low end of the range for the reserve would be 
approximately $21.2 million.  Van Fleet used this information to prepare a schedule given to the 
January 15 due diligence participants, which showed that using a 5% discount rate, the present 
value of the estimated range for the leakage reserve ranged from $21.2 million to $30.8 million.  
The Bank had never before discounted the reserve in this manner.  The book balance of $20.2 
million, which was still $1 million less than the amount calculated improperly using the present 
value analysis remained unchanged.  By failing to adjust its books and records and financial 
statements to properly reflect the calculated reserve, Huntington violated GAAP.  Hoaglin, who 
received a copy of the January 11 meeting minutes and attended the January 15 meeting at which 
the issue was discussed, and McMennamin and Van Fleet, who attended both meetings, all knew 
about the misstatement before the 2002 Form 10-K was filed.  By failing to make the adjustment, 
Huntington overstated its 2002 operating earnings by $1.8 million, or one cent per share. 
 
                   9. Impact of 2002 Accounting Misstatements on Operating Earnings and EPS  

       In 2002, the accounting misstatements enabled Huntington to report operating earnings  
per share of $1.35, beating consensus analyst estimates for 2002 by $.02 and precisely meeting 
Target EPS bonus levels.  The impact of the misstatements on earnings and earnings per share is 
set forth in the table below: 
           Y ear                                                 Amount (in   Operating

       10.     The November 14, 2003 Restatement  

         On July 17, 2003, Huntington issued a press release announcing a series of voluntary 
steps in reaction to the Commission’s investigation, including a decision to restate its earnings to 
address certain accounting issues.  On November 14, 2003 Huntington filed an amended Form  
10-K with the Commission which restated its 2001 and 2002 earnings.  The restatement 
corrected the improper accounting for loan and lease origination fees and costs, commission 
expenses, pension settlement costs, and officer’s life insurance gain.  
  
D.      LEGAL ANALYSIS 
 
       Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act prohibits obtaining money or property by means of 
untrue statements of material fact or misleading omissions of material fact in the offer or sale of 
securities.  Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act prohibits engaging in transactions, practices or 
courses of business which operate or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser in the 
offer or sale of securities.  Information is material where there is a substantial likelihood that a 
reasonable investor would consider the information important in making an investment decision.  
Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 (1988).  Establishing violations of Sections 17(a)(2) 
and 17(a)(3) does not require a showing of scienter.  Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 697 (1980). 
Under SAB 99, misstatements in financial statements of even a small magnitude may be material 
depending on the surrounding facts and circumstances.  See Ganino v. Citizens Utilities Co., 228 
F.3d 154, 162-64 (2d Cir. 2000) (rejecting holding that 1.7% overstatement of revenues was 
immaterial as a matter of law).  And SAB 99 notes that materiality is defined in qualitative as 
well as quantitative terms and states that accounting adjustments that affect executive 
compensation or hide a failure to meet analyst consensus expectations may be material.  
Moreover, materiality of misstatements in financial statements can be established by subsequent 
corrective accounting action (such as a restatement).  See In re Peritus Software Services, Inc. 
Securities Litigation, 52 F. Supp.2d 211, 223 (D. Mass. 1999).  Form 10-K requires included 
financial statements to contain the information required by Regulation S-X, which in turn 
provides that financial statements in Commission filings that do not comply with GAAP are 
presumed misleading.  See Regulation S-X, 17 C.F.R. Section 210.4-01(a)(1). 
 
         Huntington, McMennamin, and Van Fleet violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of 
the Securities Act in 2001 and 2002.  Hoaglin caused Huntington’s 2002 violation of Section 
17(a)(2) of the Securities Act.  Huntington’s November 14, 2003 amended Form 10-K restated 
its financial condition at December 31, 2002 and 2001 and its results of operations for each of 
the three years ended December 31, 2002 to (1) apply on a retroactive basis, deferral accounting 
for loan and lease origination fees and costs as required under FAS 91; (2) correct for the errors 
in deferring fees paid to originate deposits; (3) recognize the gain on BOLI in 2001 rather than 

                                          - 11 -

---------------------Page 12---------------------

2002; and (4) recognize the $2.2 million pension settlement cost in 2002.  Huntington’s 
restatements are admissions of material errors in violation of GAAP, which requires restatement 
only for material financial misstatements.  In addition to the four restated items, Huntington 
misstated a special non-operating reserve for restructuring its Florida banking and insurance 
operations, and its auto residual value or “leakage reserve,” enabling the Company to meet 
analysts’ expectations and triggering executive bonuses.  All of Huntington’s accounting 
adjustments were qualitatively material misstatements.  All of the accounting adjustments 
directly or indirectly increased reported income during a period by causing improper recording 
of revenue or deferring of expenses.  Huntington’s decisions to improperly recognize revenue 
and defer expenses, fail to disclose changes in accounting methods, and misclassify earnings 
enabled the Bank to meet or exceed analysts’ expectations and increase management bonuses. 
 
       Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-1 thereunder require all issuers  with 
securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file annual reports.  Exchange Act 
Rule 12b-20 further requires that, in addition to the information expressly required to be included 
in such reports, the issuer must include such additional material information as may be necessary 
to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not 
misleading.  The obligation to file these periodic reports includes the obligation that they be 
complete and accurate in  all material respects. See, e.g., SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 
1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert.  denied, 440 U.S. 913 (1979); United States v. Bilzerian, 926 
F.2d 1285, 1298 (2d Cir.), cert. denied                          , 502 U.S. 813 (1991).  No showing of scienter is 
necessary to establish a violation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 12b­
20.  See Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d at 1167; SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 
1978).   Rule 13a-1 requires the filing of annual reports that comply with the Commission’s 
Regulation S-X, which requires that financial statements be presented in conformity with GAAP. 
        
       Huntington violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 
and 13a-1 by incorporating materially false and misleading financial statements in its annual 
reports for 2001 and 2002.  The financial statements were false and misleading because they 
were not presented in conformity with GAAP.  The financial statements improperly recognized 
loan and lease origination fees as income, improperly capitalized commission expenses, 
improperly deferred pension costs, misstated reserves, improperly deferred income, and 
misclassified non-operating income, enabling the Company to meet analysts’ expectations and 
triggering management bonuses for Hoaglin, McMennamin, Van Fleet, and others.  By engaging 
in the conduct described above, McMennamin and Van Fleet  caused Huntington’s 2001 and 
2002 violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder 
and Hoaglin caused Huntington’s 2002 violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and 
Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  
 
       Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to “make and keep books, 
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.”  Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires 
issuers to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide 
reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of 
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain the accountability of assets.  No 
showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation of Section 13(b)(2)(A) or 13(b)(2)(B).

---------------------Page 13---------------------

See SEC v. World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd., 567 F. Supp. 724, 749-51 (N.D. Ga. 1983). 
Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act prohibits any person from knowingly circumventing or 
knowingly failing to implement a system of internal accounting controls or knowingly falsifying 
any book, record, or account required to be made and kept by Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange 
Act.  Rule 13b2-1 prohibits any person from directly or indirectly falsifying or causing to be 
falsified any book, record, or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.  
Huntington violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) in 2001 and 2002 by fa  iling to maintain 
sufficient internal accounting controls.  In 2001 and 2002, McMennamin and Van Fleet violated                                                                                  
Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and caused Huntington’s 
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act.  Hoaglin caused Huntington’s 
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act in 2002.   
  
       Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act requires an issuer’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer to certify the financial information contained in the issuer’s quarterly and 
annual reports.  Huntington’s CEO and CFO, Hoaglin and McMennamin, violated Exchange Act 
Rule 13a-14 by certifying to the Commission that Huntington’s Form 10-K for 2002:  (1) was 
complete and accurate; (2) fairly presented the financial condition of Huntington; and (3) did not 
contain any untrue statements.  The certifications were inaccurate because, as discussed above, 
the report contained material misstatements and omissions, the financial statements did not fairly 
present Huntington’s true financial condition, and the procedures utilized by Huntington in 
support of the certifications were deficient.  
 
       Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that:  (i) Huntington violated Section 
17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the 
Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder; (ii) Hoaglin caused Huntington’s 
violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of 
the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder; (iii) McMennamin and Van Fleet 
violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange 
Act, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and caused Huntington’s violations of Sections 13(a) and 
13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder; (iv) Hoaglin 
and McMennamin violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14; and (v) Van Fleet willfully       4
                                                                                      violated 
Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and 
Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. 

E.     UNDERTAKING   

       McMennamin undertakes and agrees that for a period of five years from the date of the 
issuance of the Order that he will not act as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of 
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78(l)] or that is 
required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78o(d)].  In 
                                                 
4 
 “Willfully” as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation.  See 
Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000);         Tager v. SEC    , 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965). There is no                   
requirement that the actor also be    aware that he or she is violating one of the Rules or Acts.

determining whether to accept McMennamin’s Offer, the Commission has considered this 
undertaking. 
        
                                             IV. 
 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents’ Offers. 
 
       Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY  ORDERED, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act 
and Section 21C of the Exchange Act that:  
 
A.     Respondent Huntington shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations 
and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Sections 
13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  
 
B.     Respondent Huntington shall, within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order, pay

                        (b)      Respondent Van Fleet, or th    e registered public accounting firm 
with which he is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify 
any criticisms of or potential defects in the respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that

not conducted an inspection, has received an unqualified report relating to his, or the firm’s, most 
recent peer review conducted in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the former SEC

standards. 
 
K.      The Commission will consider an application by Respondent Van Fleet to resume  
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and 
he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.  
However, if state licensure is dependant on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission 
will consider an application on its other merits.  The Commission’s review may include  
consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to 
Respondent Van Fleet’s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or 
practice before the Commission. 
 
L.      There shall be, pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a Fair
