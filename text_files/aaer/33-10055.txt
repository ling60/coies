       On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds    that:    
 
                                            Summary 

       1.      ModusLink is a Massachusetts-based company that provides supply chain and 
logistics services to other companies.  In providing products and services to its clients, ModusLink 
routinely purchased products and services from third-party vendors on behalf of its clients.  
ModusLink also routinely obtained rebates from vendors.  In numerous instances, and without a 
sufficient basis to conclude that it was entitled to do so, ModusLink kept rebates that should have 
benefited certain ModusLink clients, which were contractually entitled to them under cost-plus and 
pass-through contracts.  In some other instances, ModusLink marked-up the prices charged by the 
vendors and billed the higher price to certain ModusLink clients, also in contravention of their 
contracts.  ModusLink had no legal entitlement to these rebates and mark-ups and inappropriately 
included these sums in computing and reporting its revenue and net income in its financial 
statements filed with the Commission. 

       2.      In June 2012, ModusLink announced its intent to restate certain financial 
statements, which it did in January 2013, restating more than five years of inaccurate financial 
statements that had appeared in the company’s periodic filings with the Commission.  The restated 
financial statements reversed the revenue and net income ModusLink had inappropriately reported 
from these rebates and mark-ups.  As a result of these practices, ModusLink misstated its net 
income by up to 1038%, 23%, and 22% in certain years. 

       3.      ModusLink’s financial misstatements resulted from failures to act reasonably at 
every level in the company.  ModusLink’s management was made aware on multiple occasions 
that certain rebates needed to be passed through to clients.  Although ModusLink’s management 
directed subordinates to pursue rebates aggressively and set rebate targets for those subordinates to 
hit, management failed to take appropriate steps to ensure rebates were passed on to clients when 
required.  Simultaneously, ModusLink’s operations staff worked with vendors to implement covert 
procedures to obtain rebates, and rebate information was kept secret from client-facing sales staff.  
And when an internal whistleblower alerted the Internal Audit department and the company’s 
Audit Committee, the resulting review was incomplete and ineffective.  In addition, staff sitting at 
the intersection between operations and corporate staff responsible for financial reporting during 
this time, including the CFO of the Supply Chain Business Unit, Catherine L. Venable, failed to 
ensure that such rebates and mark-ups were accurately reflected in ModusLink’s books and 
records.

on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

       4.     ModusLink’s then-Chief Executive Officer, Joseph C. Lawler, and then-Chief 
Financial Officer, Steven G. Crane, both received bonuses, incentive compensation, and/or 
equity-based compensation during the 12-month periods following certain of the filings 
ModusLink restated.  Neither Lawler nor Crane, however, has reimbursed any portion of this 
compensation to ModusLink pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

                                       Respondents 

       5.     ModusLink Global Solutions, Inc., is a Delaware corporation with its corporate 
headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts.  Its common stock is registered pursuant to Section 12 of 
the Exchange Act and traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “MLNK.”  Before 2008, 
ModusLink operated under the names CMGI, Inc. and CMG Information Services, Inc.  In its 
Form 10-K filing for its fiscal year 2015 (filed October 14, 2015), ModusLink reported net revenue 
of $561.7 million, an operating loss of $14.3 million, and a net loss of $18.4 million.  Nearly all of 
ModusLink’s current officers and directors joined the company in the period since ModusLink 
announced its intention to restate its financial statements in June 2012. 

       6.     Joseph C. Lawler, age 65, lives in Skokie, IL.  From August 2004 to 2012, he was 
ModusLink’s President and Chief Executive Officer.  Lawler was also a ModusLink director from 
August 2004 to June 2012, and Chairman of the Board from August 2006 to November 2011.  

       7.     Steven G. Crane, age 58, lives in Charleston, SC.  From April 2007 to 2014, he 
was ModusLink’s Chief Financial Officer.  Crane was also ModusLink’s Treasurer from April 
2007 to June 2008.  

       8.     Catherine L. Venable, age 51, lives in Gold Canyon, AZ.  From 2008 to 2010, she 
was ModusLink’s CFO of Global Operations and from 2010 to 2012, she was ModusLink’s CFO 
of the Supply Chain Business Unit.  Venable was also the CFO of the Americas region from 2005-
2007 and CFO of the Asia and Europe regions from 2007-2008.  Venable held a CPA license from 
1989 to 2003.  

                          ModusLink’s Business and Pricing Models 
                                                
       9.     ModusLink provides “global supply chain business process management” primarily 
to computer, electronics, and communications companies.  Its supply chain management business 
manufactures, stores, and distributes for sale its clients’ products.  ModusLink operates in North 
America, Europe, and Asia.   

       10.    Often as part of its supply chain services, ModusLink buys components (such as 
power cords or compact discs), raw materials (such as corrugated cardboard), or auxiliary services 
(such as printing) on behalf of its clients.   

       11.    ModusLink enters into contracts with clients that can employ one or more of three 
models for pricing those components, materials, and/or  auxiliary services: 

                                               3  
 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

           a.  “Cost” or “Pass-through” model:  Costs incurred by ModusLink to purchase 
               components, materials, and/or  auxiliary services are passed through directly to the 
               client; 

           b.  “Cost-Plus” model:  The client agrees to pay the costs incurred by ModusLink  to 
               purchase components, materials, and/or  auxiliary services, plus an agreed-to 
               percentage mark-up on those costs; 

           c.   “Fixed-Price” model:  ModusLink and its client negotiate a fixed unit price for the 
               supply chain services to be provided, where the level of costs incurred by 
               ModusLink does not determine the contractual price. 

       12.    ModusLink’s biggest clients tended to have cost or cost-plus contracts, as those 
clients had more bargaining power with ModusLink; smaller clients tended to have fixed-price 
contracts.  At the time of its restatement, approximately 17% of ModusLink’s contracts were cost, 
33% were cost-plus, and 50% were fixed price.    
        
       13.    ModusLink’s business model – which included purchasing commodity materials in 
bulk and charging its clients for the materials, as described above – resulted in high revenues 
(approximately $1 billion annually), but low profit margins for ModusLink as a whole during the 
five and one-half year restatement period (2007-2012).  During that period, ModusLink turned an 
annual profit only twice ($37.7 million in 2007 and $0.5 million in 2008). 

                    ModusLink’s Retention of Rebates and Cost Mark-Ups 

       14.    Beginning no later than the mid-2000s and extending through the first half of 2012, 
ModusLink negotiated for certain of its vendors to pay rebates to ModusLink on the components, 
materials, and auxiliary services ModusLink bought from the vendors to fulfill its contracts with its 
clients.  ModusLink used its size and purchasing power to arrange rebates with vendors whenever 
possible. 

       15.    Rebate amounts would generally be calculated per-unit (e.g., 10 cents or 10% off 
per item) or based on ModusLink hitting certain volume criteria (in which cases the rebates were 
sometimes termed “volume discounts”).  The rebates effectively lowered the actual price 
ModusLink paid the vendors for the components, materials, and auxiliary services purchased, and 
were accounted for as a reduction in ModusLink’s material costs (i.e., cost of goods sold).    

       16.    Notwithstanding the fact that the rebates lowered ModusLink’s vendor costs, 
ModusLink generally did not pass the cost savings through to its clients, including those with cost 
and cost-plus contracts that required such savings to be passed on to the clients.  Instead, 
ModusLink generally kept the rebate savings for itself and billed the clients at the original, pre-
rebate (higher) price charged by vendors.   

       17.    At times, ModusLink negotiated the rebate amount with a vendor at the same time 
that it negotiated the original price for the product or service with the same vendor.  In these 
instances, ModusLink directed the vendor to bill ModusLink at the original price – rather than the 
                                                4  
 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

“net” price, inclusive of the rebate.  The original (higher) price was used to bill ModusLink’s 
clients. 

       18.    For example, if ModusLink needed to provide a power cord for a client with a cost 
contract, it might negotiate with a vendor to supply that power cord for $1 with a 10% rebate.  
ModusLink would initially pay $1 to the vendor for each power cord and then bill the client for the 
$1 paid to the vendor.  At a later point (generally at month-end or quarter-end), however, 
ModusLink would receive 10 cents back from the vendor.  Despite ModusLink’s true cost of 90 
cents, ModusLink generally did not pass back to its clients the 10 cents per power cord, but instead 
kept the 10 cents for itself. 

       19.    Rebates were a key element of profitability at ModusLink, often comprising a 
substantial portion of the company’s net income for the quarter or year.  One executive referred to 
rebates as “pure profit,” and they were considered part of ModusLink’s business model. 
Notwithstanding their direct impact on ModusLink’s bottom line and their importance to 
ModusLink’s business, however, ModusLink’s SEC filings did not identify or describe rebates in 
any way before the SEC began an investigation into its rebate practices.  

       20.    ModusLink also added profit to its bottom line by directly marking up vendor costs.   
In some instances, however, mark-ups were added in contravention of certain clients’ cost or cost-
plus contracts, which called for vendor costs to be either passed-through to clients with no mark-
ups or with only agreed-upon mark-ups. 

       21.    As described more fully below, ModusLink’s retention of vendor rebates and mark-
ups in contravention of certain clients’ cost and cost-plus contracts resulted in ModusLink 
retaining revenue and net income to which it was not entitled.  The following chart compares the 
net income ModusLink originally reported in its Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Commission 
with the amounts that ModusLink restated in 2013 based on its improper rebate and mark-up 
practices.  While ModusLink’s revenues were misstated by less than 1% in each period, its net 
income was misstated exponentially more.

                   ModusLink Failed to Ensure the Accurate Treatment of Rebates 

       22.    ModusLink’s financial misstatements resulted from failures to act reasonably at 
every level in the company.  Despite being aware that certain rebates could not be kept by 
ModusLink, the company nevertheless aggressively – and covertly – pursued rebates from vendors 
without regard to its contractual obligations to clients with cost and cost-plus contracts. 
                                                 5  
 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

       23.    ModusLink personnel generally knew, at least as to ModusLink’s larger clients, 
which had cost and cost-plus contracts and which did not.  Client pricing models – which were 
critically important to whether ModusLink would turn a profit on a particular client’s business – 
were reviewed when ModusLink considered both new business projects and existing business 
projects. 

       24.    ModusLink’s pursuit and retention of vendor rebates was also well known to, and 
driven by, ModusLink’s management. Management put pressure on the operations staff to 
aggressively pursue rebates as a way to reduce ModusLink’s costs and improve its profits.  As part 
of the budget process, management set targets for the amount of rebates the business units were 
expected to obtain. 

       25.    Management would thereafter periodically receive reports on the company’s 
success obtaining rebates and their effect on the company’s financial performance.   Rebates were 
also regularly discussed in reports from ModusLink’s business units.  

       26.    The possibility of obtaining new rebates was also periodically a factor when 
ModusLink considered whether a new business project was expected to be sufficiently profitable to 
undertake. 

       27.    Management was informed on multiple occasions that the company could not keep 
vendor rebates associated with clients on cost and cost-plus contracts, including in memos and 
reports authored by or received by ModusLink’s managers.   

       28.    Management was also apprised on multiple occasions that ModusLink was marking 
up vendor costs on business associated with some of its biggest clients, including clients with 
which ModusLink had cost or cost-plus contracts. 

       29.    Notwithstanding management’s general knowledge of its clients’ contracts and 
knowledge of the company’s pursuit of rebates and mark-ups, ModusLink did not have any 
meaningful processes in place to ensure rebates and mark-ups were properly treated under its 
different contract models.  ModusLink failed to direct the relevant parts of the company, including 
its legal staff, operations staff, sales staff, and finance staff, to develop any procedures for the 
proper treatment of rebates.   

       30.    Ultimately, in connection with its 2013 restatement of financial statements, 
ModusLink admitted to deficiencies in its accounting and financial controls, including a failure to 
reconcile its pricing and billing processes to its contractual obligations. 

           ModusLink’s Secretive Approach to Rebate Negotiation and Retention 

       31.    ModusLink’s embrace of rebates as a profit strategy created an incentive to retain 
rebates to which it was not entitled.  Vendor rebates were pursued and implemented on the 
operations side of ModusLink’s business (rather than the client-facing sales side).  The operations 
side, accordingly, turned from a cost center into a mixed cost and profit center, with a profit goal it 
was expected to hit each year. 
                                                6  
 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

       32.    By turning the operations side of its business into a profit center, ModusLink 
engendered a competitive and contentious dynamic between sales and operations, and the 
operations staff developed practices that were aimed at increasing rebates while hiding them from 
scrutiny.  ModusLink’s internal procedures and information systems were designed to keep rebate-
related information away from sales and other client-facing personnel and to conceal rebate 
practices from clients.  Management was aware of and directed this deliberate information 
withholding, ostensibly so that sales personnel did not negotiate away the profits made from the 
rebates.  The effect was that those with the most knowledge about the client contracts – the client-
facing personnel – were kept in the dark about the company’s rebate practices.  Company-wide 
rebate information, likewise, was generally available at the management level only. 

       33.    Among the ways the operations staff kept rebate information hidden was by 
directing vendors to make sure that their invoices did not reflect the anticipated payment of rebates.  
Emails dating as far back as 2003, and as late as 2011, reflect that operations staff would arrange 
with vendors to invoice ModusLink at the higher, original price and then return the difference 
between the “real” or “net” price and the higher price to ModusLink at month- or quarter-end in 
the form of a rebate.  By keeping the rebate information off of the vendor invoices, the client-
facing sales personnel (and the clients themselves) would be unaware of the rebates. 

       34.    The ModusLink personnel responsible for the concealed rebate program hid their 
activities by providing inflated cost figures (which included the higher, non-rebated price) to those 
ModusLink employees who dealt with clients.  

       35.    In some instances, members of the operations staff pursued rebates in this fashion 
specifically because they knew that the client contracts would be structured as cost or cost-plus and 
thus they could not directly mark-up the vendor costs.   Numerous middle- and upper-level 
managers in operations received and sometimes sent emails reflecting these practices. 

       36.    At times, operations staff members clashed with sales staff members who suspected 
(accurately) that operations had included rebate-inflated prices into pricing quotes, making it 
tougher to make a sale to a client.  Members of senior management would occasionally have to 
mediate these disputes between operations and sales.  

       37.    ModusLink operations staff also made sure that its main accounting and billing 
systems did not contain detailed information regarding rebates.  These practices were designed to 
and did conceal rebates from those select clients that had contractual rights to review and audit 
what ModusLink had charged them. 

       38.    At various times, ModusLink operations staff referred to its rebate efforts internally 
                                                                            2
as a “masked pricing program” and, more colloquially, as “Scooby Snacks.”

       In the cartoon Scooby Doo, Scooby Snacks were a food item (or possibly a dog treat) frequently 
used as an incentive for the dog Scooby-Doo and his owner Shaggy.

        ModusLink Failed to Adequately Address Internal Whistleblower Complaint 

       39.    In November 2008, an anonymous whistleblower put ModusLink’s management 
and Audit Committee on notice of the problem posed by ModusLink’s rebate practices, but 
ModusLink failed to effectively respond.   

       40.    An allegation was received through ModusLink’s “EthicsPoint” system regarding 
the collection of rebates.  This system allowed for the reporting of anonymous tips concerning 
improper conduct at the company.  The allegation stated that ModusLink’s sourcing department – 
which was part of the operations function at ModusLink – was conducting a rebate program in 
which purchase orders provided to vendors and invoices received from vendors were not reduced 
by the rebate amount, and rebates were paid from vendors to ModusLink on separate paperwork.  
The allegation further asserted that these rebates were not being disclosed to clients, who were told 
they were receiving cost-plus pricing.  The allegation squarely identified the problem with this 
program: “[V]endor rebate agreements in existence [sic] which are not being passed to customers 
per the contract terms and conditions.”   

       41.    The allegation was referred to ModusLink’s Internal Audit team, which began to 
investigate the rebate program.  At the outset, the Internal Audit director identified that the 
allegation raised concerns “from a legal and accounting perspective.”  The investigation, however, 
failed to sufficiently evaluate and investigate the allegation from either perspective.   

       42.    No one at ModusLink appears to have sought either a legal or accounting opinion 
about whether ModusLink could properly charge the non-rebate price to clients on cost and cost-
plus contracts.  Nor did the Internal Audit investigation involve a review by anyone of the terms of 
the cost and cost-plus contracts to determine whether rebate amounts needed to be passed back to 
those clients.  Instead, the Internal Audit team simply asked the operations staff, including its 
finance personnel, about the rebate program, and they uniformly asserted that the collection of 
rebates was acceptable because the vendors providing the rebates served multiple ModusLink 
clients.  When the internal auditors sought historical data concerning rebate practices, they were 
told that the available data did not contain the level of detail requested and was unreliable, 
notwithstanding that the requested data was in fact being maintained by ModusLink’s operations 
staff.  Despite later being told that more detailed information was available, Internal Audit did not 
obtain or evaluate the information. 

       43.    Internal Audit, along with ModusLink’s general counsel, thereafter closed the 
EthicsPoint investigation, calling the allegation “unfounded” based on its insufficient inquiry.  In 
March 2009, Internal Audit reported to ModusLink’s Audit Committee that the investigation was 
closed and that Internal Audit had concluded that the rebates received were ModusLink’s 
“entitlement.”   

       44.    During the Internal Audit investigation, staff at ModusLink identified a risk “that a 
client could come back and ask for the rebates received on their part orders when the client 
contract holds a cost or cost-plus option.”  That risk does not appear to have been communicated to 
ModusLink’s Audit Committee when the complaint was closed. 

                                                8  
 
---------------------Page 9---------------------

       45.    The Audit Committee did not engage in any discussion or ask any questions about 
Internal Audit’s review or its conclusions.  No legal opinion was sought or obtained and no inquiry 
was made regarding the basis for the cursory conclusion reported to the Audit Committee.  In other 
words, the Audit Committee tacitly accepted Internal Audit’s report that the rebate program was 
justified. 

       46.    Following the closing of the investigation, ModusLink’s supply chain managers 
were told to review the company’s rebate practices to eliminate the risk that a client with a cost or 
cost-plus contract might seek rebates ModusLink received on that client’s business.  While the 
managers and staff reviewed the company’s rebate practices, they did nothing to change their 
fundamental nature.  ModusLink failed to implement any new processes, including any processes 
to check client contracts to determine whether they were cost or cost-plus.  Instead, the responsible 
managers merely documented the rebate practices then in existence. 

                                   Role of Catherine Venable 

       47.    Catherine Venable held the most senior finance role on the operations side of 
ModusLink’s business, CFO of Global Operations and its equivalent, from 2008 to 2012.  In prior 
years, she was CFO of the Americas (2005-2007) and CFO of Asia and Europe (2007-2008).  
Venable often served as an intermediary between operations and the corporate accounting staff on 
issues related to rebates (including, for example, whether they were sufficiently predictable to 
warrant an accrual), and was a strong and consistent advocate for rebates, given their positive 
impact on the bottom line.   

       48.    Venable was responsible for preparing the financial statements for her region and/or 
business unit (as she was promoted), which were provided to the corporate accounting staff.   

       49.    Venable was familiar with ModusLink’s client contracts.  She knew the company’s 
contracts with certain clients required pass-through pricing of vendor costs, and knew or should 
have known that certain cost savings, including rebates, had to be passed back to clients on those 
contracts. 

       50.    Venable also knew that the procurement staff was negotiating rebates from vendors 
at the direction of management.   

       51.    During her tenure, Venable repeatedly prepared financial statements knowing that 
ModusLink was retaining rebates for goods and services procured, in part or whole, for use in 
performing work for clients with cost and cost-plus contracts.  Venable unreasonably relied on the 
unfounded rationale that retention of these rebates was acceptable because the vendors providing 
the rebates were believed to be serving multiple ModusLink clients. Venable took no independent 
steps to determine whether rebates should have been or were passed back to clients with cost and 
cost-plus contracts, and thereby, through her negligence, was a cause of ModusLink’s failure to 
accurately record rebates and, by extension, its revenue and net income.

  ModusLink’s Required Restatement of Financial Statements Filed with the Commission 

       52.    On March 12, 2012, ModusLink’s Form 10-Q filing for the period ended January 
31, 2012, defended the company’s rebate practices:  

               As part of [ModusLink’s supply chain management] services and in the 
       normal course of our business we purchase certain commodity types of materials, 
       including, but not limited to, print, packaging, media and labels, to meet client 
       requirements, often in quantities well in excess of those required by any one client. 
       As a result, we receive improved pricing on materials, as well as rebates based on 
       aggregate volumes of purchases or other criteria established by the vendor. Cost of 
       revenue for the second quarter of our 2012 fiscal year included the positive impact 
       of approximately $1 million attributable to such rebates. In response to an inquiry 
       by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are currently evaluating this 
       practice, to determine the extent to which such rebates should be shared with 
       certain of our clients. Based on our operating practices, including our ongoing 
       periodic pricing negotiations with our clients, we believe the benefit of these 
       rebates is effectively shared with our clients and that our accounting for such 
       practices is correct. 
        
       53.    On June 11, 2012, ModusLink filed with the Commission a Form 8-K, along with a 
press release from the company.  The Press Release revised ModusLink’s position on rebates, 
stating,  

               Concurrent with the [Securities and Exchange Commission’s] inquiry, the 
       Audit Committee of the Board of Directors initiated an internal investigation and 
       has determined that certain client contracts have not been aligned consistently with 
       ModusLink’s practice of retaining volume discounts.  In the course of the 
       investigation, the Audit Committee also identified limited instances where vendor 
       costs incurred were marked-up to clients in a manner not consistent with client 
       contacts. 
                
       54.    ModusLink then announced that “it [was] no longer able to conclude that amounts 
from such volume discounts and mark-ups, where now found to be inconsistent with client 
contracts, were correctly accounted for as revenue.  As soon as practicable, the Company expects 
to restate its audited financial statements from fiscal years 2009 through 2011, as well as the first 
two quarters of fiscal 2012 and its unaudited selected financial data for fiscal years 2007 and 
2008.”  In other words, ModusLink announced that its financial statements from 2007 to the 
present could not be relied upon.   

       55.    On January 11, 2013, ModusLink filed an amended Form 10-K with the 
Commission in which it restated its financial results for the period 2007 through 2011 and the first 
two quarters of 2012.  In that filing, ModusLink admitted, “based on additional accounting 
evaluations conducted in connection with the investigation and in consultation with the Audit 
Committee’s advisors, the Company concluded, and recommended to the Audit Committee, that 

                                                10   
 
---------------------Page 11---------------------

revenue should not have been recognized for retained rebates and mark-ups associated with the 
cost-based client contracts.”   

       56.    The restatement resulted in a cumulative downward adjustment of $32.9 million in 
revenue, from 2007 through the first two quarters of 2012.  ModusLink adjusted net income 
downward by $18.0 million and restated its aggregate net loss of $231.1 million.  These 
adjustments flowed from the approximately $45 million ModusLink determined that it had 
improperly billed clients based on rebates and mark-ups ModusLink retained in contravention of 
client contracts. 

       57.    In a “Summary of Investigation Findings” in the Form 10-K filed on January 11, 
2013, ModusLink conceded that: 

               The errors identified in the course of the Audit Committee’s investigation 
       revealed deficiencies in the Company’s accounting and financial control 
       environment, some of which were determined to be material weaknesses.  These 
       included a failure of effective controls to track and reconcile the Company’s belief 
       that it was entitled to retain rebates and pricing mark-ups against the specific terms 
       of the contractual pricing models and cost disclosure obligations required by client 
       contracts. 

                       Compensation of CEO Lawler and CFO Crane 

       58.    During the 12-month periods following ModusLink’s filing with the Commission 
of inaccurate financial statements in its Forms 10-K for the full years of 2010 and 2011, Lawler 
and Crane received bonuses, incentive compensation, and equity-based compensation.  Neither 
Lawler nor Crane has reimbursed any portion of this compensation to ModusLink. 

                                ModusLink Offered Securities 

       59.    On December 20, 2010, ModusLink filed a Form S-8 with the Commission.  That 
filing detailed ModusLink’s registration of over five million shares of common stock, in 
connection with its adoption of a 2010 Incentive Award Plan on December 8, 2010.  The 
registration statement incorporated ModusLink’s Fiscal Year 2010 10-K, which ModusLink later 
restated, as described above.  ModusLink made this filing, and subsequently offered certain of the 
registered shares to employees, during the period it improperly billed and kept rebates and mark-
ups.  

                                           Violations 

       60.    Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act make it unlawful, in the offer or 
sale of securities, to (1) obtain money or property by means of any material misrepresentation or 
omission or (2) engage in any transaction, practice or course of business that operates or would 
operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.  Negligence is sufficient to establish violations of 
Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.  As a result of its negligent conduct described 
above, ModusLink violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act. 
                                               11   
 
---------------------Page 12---------------------

       61.    Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered 
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file periodic and other reports with the 
Commission.  With exceptions not applicable here, Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 of the Exchange Act 
require each issuer to file annual and quarterly reports respectively on the appropriate forms and 
within the period specific on the form.  Rule 12b-20 further requires that the required reports 
contain such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required 
statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made not misleading.  As a result of 
the conduct described above, ModusLink violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 
12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. 
        
       62.    Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered 
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to make and keep books, records and accounts, 
which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and dispositions of 
their assets.  As a result of the conduct described above, ModusLink violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) 
of the Exchange Act. 
        
       63.    Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered 
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to, among other things, devise and maintain a system 
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. As a result of the conduct described above, ModusLink violated 
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. 
        
       64.    As a result of her negligent conduct described above, Venable was a cause of 
ModusLink’s violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act. 
        
       65.    Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the chief executive 
officer and chief financial officer of any issuer required to prepare an accounting restatement due 
to material noncompliance with the securities laws as a result of misconduct to reimburse the 
issuer for (i) any bonus or incentive-based or equity-based compensation received by that person 
from the issuer during the 12-month periods following the false filings, and (ii) any profits 
realized from the sale of securities of the issuer during those 12-month periods.  Section 304 does 
not require that the chief executive officer or chief financial officer personally engage in 
misconduct to trigger the reimbursement requirement, and the Commission does not allege that 
Lawler and/or Crane participated in misconduct.  As described above, however, ModusLink 
engaged in misconduct giving rise to its restatement.  During the 12-month period following 
ModusLink’s filing of inaccurate financial statements in its Forms 10-K for 2010 and 2011, 
Lawler and Crane received bonuses, incentive compensation, and/or equity-based compensation.  
Neither Lawler nor Crane has, to date, reimbursed any portion of this compensation or profits 
stemming from this compensation to ModusLink.  Lawler and Crane have, therefore, violated 
Sarbanes-Oxley Section 304.

                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents’ Offers. 
 
       Accordingly, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Section 21C of the Exchange 
Act, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
       A.     Respondent ModusLink shall cease and desist from committing or causing any 
violations and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and 
Section 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 
13a-13 thereunder. 
 
       B.     Respondent ModusLink shall, within 14 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil 
money penalty in the amount of $1,600,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for 
transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 
21F(g)(3).  If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 
3717.  Payment must be made in one of the following ways:   
 
              (1)     Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which

              (2)     Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov 
                      through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or  
               
              (3)    Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United 
                      States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange

ModusLink as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy 
of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to John T. Dugan, Associate Regional 
Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, Boston Regional Office, 
33 Arch Street, Boston, MA 02110.   
        
       C.     Respondent Venable shall cease and desist from committing or causing any 
violations and any future violations Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.

       D.     Respondent Venable shall, within 14 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil 
money penalty in the amount of $20,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer 
to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3).  If 
timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3717.  
Payment must be made in one of the following ways:   
 
              (1)     Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which 
                      will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

       Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying 
Venable as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of 
the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to John T. Dugan, Associate Regional 
Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, Boston Regional Office, 
33 Arch Street, Boston, MA 02110.   
        
       E.     Respondent Lawler shall cease and desist from committing or causing any 
violations and any future violations of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
        
       F.     Respondent Lawler shall, within 14 days of the entry of this Order, reimburse 
ModusLink for cash and equity incentive compensation in the amount of $78,991 and 24,200 
shares of common stock (or the cash equivalent value calculated based on the last closing stock 
price as of the date of this Order) pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  
Respondent Lawler shall simultaneously deliver proof of satisfying this reimbursement obligation 
to John T. Dugan, Associate Regional Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Boston Regional Office, 33 Arch Street, Boston, MA 02110.   
        
       G.     Respondent Crane shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations 
and any future violations of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

---------------------Page 15---------------------

$51,957.60 pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Respondent Crane shall 
simultaneously deliver proof of satisfying this reimbursement obligation to John T. Dugan, 
Associate Regional Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Boston Regional Office, 33 Arch Street, Boston, MA 02110.   
        
       I.      Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be 
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes.  To 
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents ModusLink and Venable agree that 
in any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit 
by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of 
Respondents ModusLink’s and Venable’s payment of a civil penalty in this action (“Penalty 
Offset”).  If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents 
ModusLink and Venable agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting 
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of the 
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Such a payment shall not be deemed 
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty 
imposed in this proceeding.  For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a 
private damages action brought against one or more Respondents by or on behalf of one or more 
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the 
Commission in this proceeding. 
 
                                                V. 

       It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section 
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by 
Respondents, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other 
amounts due by Respondents under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree 
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by 
Respondents of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set 
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
