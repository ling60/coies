                                               II. 

       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers 
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the 
findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of 
these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents 
consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings 
Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings 
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Cease-and-Desist Orders (“Order”), as set forth below.  

                                               III. 

                                                                                  1
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds     that:  

                                          SUMMARY 

       1.     Orrstown Financial Services, Inc., is a publicly traded bank holding company 
whose principal business activity consists of owning and supervising its wholly owned 
subsidiary, Orrstown Bank (collectively, “Orrstown” or the “Bank”). Orrstown provides banking 
and bank related services, which include, among other things, commercial lending. As of 
December 31, 2010, approximately 75% of the Bank’s $964 million loan portfolio consisted of 
commercial loans. 

       2.     In 2010, as Orrstown’s primary lending markets were experiencing a significant 
decline in real estate values, Orrstown incorrectly accounted for its commercial loans by not 
disclosing as much as approximately $69.5 million in loans as “impaired” in accordance with 
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  

       3.     GAAP states that a loan is “impaired” when, based on current information and 
events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the 
contractual terms of the loan agreement. For purposes of its periodic reporting requirements, a 
company is required by GAAP to evaluate whether or not a loan is impaired and disclose the 
total amount of impaired loans. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, GAAP requires a 
company to estimate the uncollectible portion of the loan and record that amount as impairment 
loss in its financial statements. 

       4.     Here, Orrstown did not comply with GAAP’s impaired loan disclosure 
requirements due to certain Respondents’ negligence and Orrstown’s lack of sufficient internal 
accounting controls. This failure resulted in material misstatements in Orrstown’s impaired loan

       The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers and are not binding on any other person or 
entity in this or any other proceeding.

disclosures in its quarterly filings for the periods ended June 30, 2010 through September 30, 
2011, and its annual filings for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 (the “Relevant 
Period”). 

       5.     Additionally, Orrstown (i) did not calculate loan losses in accordance with GAAP 
in connection with the filing of its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011, (ii) incorrectly 
implemented a newly issued GAAP accounting pronouncement in connection with the filing of 
its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011 in a manner that was not consistent with the 
new standard, and (iii) incorrectly applied GAAP when calculating fair value for certain 
collateral in connection with its impairment analyses for its Form 10-Q for the periods ended 
June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010. 

       6.     As a result of the conduct described herein, Orrstown violated Sections 17(a)(2) 
and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, the reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act 
and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, the books and records provisions of Section 
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and the internal accounting control provisions of Section 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.  

       7.     As a result of the conduct described herein, Respondents Thomas R. Quinn, Jr., 
Orrstown’s Chief Executive Officer, Bradley S. Everly, Orrstown’s former Chief Financial 
Officer, and Jeffrey W. Embly, Orrstown’s former Chief Credit Officer, violated Securities Act 
Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and caused Respondent Orrstown 
to violate Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-
13 thereunder. Respondents Quinn and Everly also violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. 
Respondent Douglas P. Barton, Orrstown’s Chief Accounting Officer, violated Exchange Act 
Rule 13b2-1 and caused Orrstown to violate Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), 
and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.

       13.    Lending Relationship A consisted of a husband and wife, their adult sons, and 
the husband’s brother. All were customers of the Bank individually and through various entities 
they controlled. Lending Relationship A were real estate investors and developers primarily in

       14.    Lending Relationship B consisted of a father and son who were customers of the 
Bank individually and through various entities they controlled. They were real estate investors 
and developers primarily in the Hagerstown, Maryland market. They are no longer customers of 
the Bank. 

       15.    Lending Relationship C consisted of an individual customer of the Bank and 
various entities he controlled. Lending Relationship C engaged in real estate investment and

                              ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

       16.    The relevant accounting standards governing Orrstown’s identification, 
assessment and measurement of impaired loans are set forth in Accounting Standards 
Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 310-10-35, Receivables – Subsequent Measurement. The 
relevant accounting standards providing guidance on disclosure of loans that are individually 
deemed to be impaired are set forth in ASC 310-10-50 Receivables – Disclosure. 

       17.    ASC 310-10-50-15 requires that an entity disclose, as of the date of each 
statement of financial position presented, its recorded investment in impaired loans. 

       18.    ASC 310-10-35-14 requires that a creditor apply its normal loan review 
procedures in identifying loans to be evaluated for collectability and includes certain criteria that 
are useful in identifying loans for evaluation. 

       19.    ASC 310-10-35-16 requires a creditor to identify a loan as impaired if, based on 
current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts 
due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. 

                                              4 
 
 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

       20.    ASC 310-10-35-22 requires a creditor to measure an impaired loan’s impairment 
based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective 
interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, a creditor may measure impairment based on a 
loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is a collateral-
dependent loan. 

       21.    Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-02, A Creditor’s Determination 
of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring (“ASU 2011-02”), codified as ASC 
310-40, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, clarified existing troubled debt restructuring 
(“TDR”) guidance by providing guidelines for determining when a restructuring constitutes a 
concession and when a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. A restructuring of a debt 
constitutes a TDR if the creditor for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor’s financial 
difficulties grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. ASU 2011-02 
was issued in April 2011 and was effective for the first interim or annual reporting period 
beginning on or after June 15, 2011 and should have been applied retroactively to the beginning 
of the annual period of adoption (i.e., restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the 
fiscal year of adoption).  

                                            FACTS 

                               Orrstown’s Loan Review Process 

       22.    During the Relevant Period, Orrstown’s loan review process was governed by its 
loan policy. The loan review was performed by a Loan Review Officer who was supervised by 
Embly and Orrstown’s Credit Administration Committee. The Credit Administration Committee 
consisted of non-employee directors, though Quinn, Everly and Embly regularly attended 
meetings as non-voting members. 

       23.    Orrstown’s loan policy required the Loan Review Officer to conduct a risk review 
of forty-five percent to sixty percent of the Bank’s total outstanding loan portfolio annually. 
Based on this review of relevant loan files, the Loan Review Officer assigned a risk rating to 
each relationship in accordance with a predetermined risk rating system that ranged from “1 – 
Excellent” to “8 – Loss.” Loans rated “6 – Substandard,” “7 – Doubtful,” and “8 – Loss” were 
considered “classified” loans and represented the subset of the loan portfolio where risk of 
uncollectability was greatest. As a matter of practice all commercial relationships with a 
committed loan balance over $750,000 were risk rated each year. 

       24.    During the Relevant Period, the loan policy further required that, on a quarterly 
basis, the Loan Review Officer review Orrstown’s allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) 
to ensure that the Bank was adequately reserved for projected loan and lease losses. In 
connection with this review, the Loan Review Officer evaluated only “Substandard” loans to 
determine if they were impaired and whether a provision for loan loss was required to be 
recorded in the financial statements.  

       25.    As discussed in greater detail below, Orrstown did not timely incorporate material 
adverse information regarding certain borrowers’ financial difficulties into the risk rating 

                                               5 
 
 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

component of its loan review process and instead relied largely on stale data. As a result, loans 
were incorrectly risk rated. Moreover, the processes and controls in place to ensure the accuracy 
of risk ratings set by the Loan Review Officer were ineffective to prevent or correct the incorrect 
risk ratings. 

                 Loans to Several of Orrstown’s Largest Lending Relationships 
                               Were Not Disclosed as Impaired 

       26.    In 2010, three of the Bank’s largest customers, Lending Relationships A, B and C, 
approached Orrstown requesting to modify the terms of their loans, each claiming they had 
insufficient cash flow to repay their existing loans with Orrstown. These borrowers’ cash flow 
problems were discussed at meetings of Orrstown’s Loan Committee, Executive Committee 
and/or Board of Directors. As attendees at these meetings, Quinn, Everly and Embly knew or 
should have known that the loans to Lending Relationships A, B and C were impaired or, at a 
minimum, that these loans needed to be evaluated for impairment. Quinn, Everly and Embly 
received copies of the internal loan presentation materials that set forth the borrowers’ financial 
difficulties, but Quinn, Everly and Embly did not raise any concerns about whether the loans 
should have been disclosed as impaired in accordance with ASC 310-10-50-12, or identified for 
impairment analysis in accordance with ASC 310-10-35-14 and ASC 310-10-35-16. In 2012 and 
2013, Orrstown sold the Lending Relationships A, B and C loans at a substantial discount to their 
carrying values. 

   A.  Lending Relationship A 

       27.    As of December 31, 2010, outstanding loans to Lending Relationship A totaled 
approximately $28.8 million. By July 13, 2010, Quinn, Everly and Embly knew or should have 
known through loan presentation materials distributed at various committee meetings they 
attended that the patriarch of Lending Relationship A was “struggling with cash flow” due to the 
weakening real estate market. In or about the same time, Quinn, Everly and Embly were told that 
the adult children, also borrowers, were “experiencing significant cash flow issues” and had 
threatened to surrender their properties to the Bank. Earlier in May 2010, the patriarch’s brother, 
himself a borrower, informed the Bank that he was “short” on money to continue construction of 
his real estate projects. By December 9, 2010, Quinn, Everly and Embly were told that the 
patriarch’s brother was still suffering the effects of the weakening economy, which hindered his 
development plans. As a result of these financial difficulties, in 2010 Orrstown modified the 
terms of approximately $21.5 million in loans to Lending Relationship A but did not evaluate, 
identify, or disclose the loans as impaired, as required by GAAP. 

   B.  Lending Relationship B 

       28.    As of December 31, 2010, outstanding loans to Lending Relationship B totaled 
$12.2 million. As early as June 8, 2010, Lending Relationship B requested loan modifications 
because their commercial properties were “producing a negative cash flow after debt service.” 
By June 28, 2010, Lending Relationship B had mentioned to the Bank on multiple occasions the 
possibility of filing for bankruptcy. And by December 17, 2010, Quinn, Everly and Embly knew 
or should have known that Lending Relationship B’s largest financed project was potentially 

                                               6 
 
 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

“jeopardized” and that the borrowers were suffering the effects of the weakening economy and 
experiencing “significantly strained cash flow[s].” Despite this information, on December 23, 
2010, Orrstown approved modifications to the terms of Lending Relationship B loans but did not 
evaluate, identify, or disclose them as impaired as required by GAAP. 

   C.  Lending Relationship C 

       29.    As of December 31, 2010, outstanding loans to Lending Relationship C totaled 
$7.7 million. By September 8, 2010, Quinn, Everly and Embly knew or should have known that 
the Bank had met with the principal for Lending Relationship C and one of his business partners 
to discuss the declining economy’s impact on their commercial real estate portfolio. Quinn, 
Everly and Embly knew or should have known that Lending Relationship C and the partner were 
having “serious cash flow deficiencies.” As a result, Orrstown agreed to modify many of these 
loans in September and October 2010 but did not evaluate, identify, or disclose them as impaired 
as required by GAAP. 

               Orrstown Did Not Disclose Other Commercial Loans as Impaired  
                         at the Time it Recognized Impairment Losses 

       30.    In addition to Lending Relationships A, B and C, Orrstown incorrectly did not 
disclose the value of other impaired loans in its quarterly filings on Form 10-Q for the periods 
ended June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010. During Q2 and Q3 2010, in connection with its 
quarterly review and assessment of the adequacy of its ALLL, Orrstown’s Loan Review Officer 
performed an analysis to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any, required under ASC 
310-10-35, on individual loans rated “Substandard.” Under GAAP, loans with an impairment 
loss must be disclosed as impaired. 

       31.    As part of this Q2 and Q3 2010 review of Orrstown’s ALLL, the Loan Review 
Officer followed the Bank’s loan policy by comparing the value at which the Bank carried each 
classified loan on its books and records, to the estimated net realizable value of the collateral 
securing each loan. Consistent with the Bank’s loan policy, in instances where the loan’s 
carrying value exceeded the estimate of the collateral’s net realizable value, an impairment loss 
was recorded in the amount of the difference. However, certain loans where impairment losses 
were calculated were incorrectly not included in the Loan Review Officer’s ALLL schedule of 
impaired loans. 

       32.    As a result, the Q2 and Q3 2010 Forms 10-Q disclosures incorrectly omitted 
impaired loans in the amounts of approximately $5.6 million as of June 30, 2010 and 
approximately $18.5 million as of September 30, 2010. 

       33.    The Loan Review Officer’s calculation of impairment losses was memorialized 
and distributed to the Credit Administration Committee, which reviewed it but did not ensure 
that loans with impairment losses were designated as impaired in Orrstown’s books and records 
(the ALLL schedule). These inaccurate books and records were then used to prepare Orrstown’s 
impaired loan disclosures included in its Q2 and Q3 2010 Forms 10-Q. Because Orrstown did 

                                               7 
 
 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

not include the value of these impairments in its impaired loan disclosures, the disclosures were 
materially misstated. 

       34.    Everly and Embly were directly notified that the Loan Review Officer did not 
appropriately record as impaired in Orrstown’s books and records loans that had been assigned 
impairment losses. Specifically, in October 2010, Barton reviewed the Loan Review Officer’s 
ALLL schedule, which included the impairment loss analysis discussed above, and informed 
Everly and Embly that failing to disclose loans with impairment losses as impaired was 
inconsistent with the accounting guidance. No one took corrective action. As a result, Orrstown’s 
Q3 2010 Form 10-Q was filed without accurately disclosing Orrstown’s recorded investment in 
impaired loans in accordance with GAAP. 

             Orrstown Did Not Accurately Disclose Impaired Loans Which Caused  
                            it to Make Materially Misstated Filings 

       35.    Orrstown did not accurately record certain loans as impaired, resulting in 
materially misstated periodic filings filed with the Commission. The following Orrstown filings 
were materially misstated in the manner described below: 

              a.  Orrstown filed its Q2 2010 Form 10-Q with the Commission on August 5, 
                  2010. In its filing, Orrstown disclosed in its Management’s Discussion and 
                  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) 
                  impaired loans of approximately $21.7 million. Orrstown did not disclose 
                  approximately $46.6 million of additional impaired loans, an understatement 
                  of approximately 215%. 

              b.  Orrstown filed its Q3 2010 Form 10-Q with the Commission on November 5, 
                  2010. In its filing, Orrstown disclosed in its MD&A impaired loans of 
                  approximately $22.6 million. Orrstown did not disclose approximately $69.5 
                  million of additional impaired loans, an understatement of approximately 
                  308%. 

              c.  Orrstown filed its 2010 Form 10-K with the Commission on March 11, 2011. 
                  In its filing, Orrstown disclosed impaired loans in the footnotes to its financial 
                  statements of approximately $14.7 million. Orrstown did not disclose 
                  approximately $51.0 million of additional impaired loans, an understatement 
                  of approximately 346%. 

              d.  Orrstown filed its Q1 2011 Form 10-Q with the Commission on May 10, 
                  2011. In its filing, Orrstown disclosed impaired loans in the footnotes to its 
                  financial statements of approximately $14.1 million. Orrstown did not 
                  disclose approximately $51.0 million of additional impaired loans, an 
                  understatement of approximately 362%. 

                                               8 
 
 
---------------------Page 9---------------------

       36.    The misstatement in Orrstown’s 2010 Form 10-K described above was repeated 
in the footnotes to the financial statements included in Orrstown’s Q2 2011 Form 10-Q, Q3 2011 
Form 10-Q and 2011 Form 10-K. 

               Orrstown Did Not Make and Keep Adequate Books and Records  
                by Failing to Comply with GAAP Provisions Relating to TDRs  
                                       and Loan Losses 

   A. Incorrect Application of the Provisions of ASU 2011-02 

       37.    In connection with the preparation of its Q2 2011 Form 10-Q, Orrstown elected to 
early adopt the provisions of ASU 2011-02. This new accounting guidance was to be applied 
retroactively to identify and report restructurings that occurred on or after January 1, 2011 that 
qualified as TDRs. 

       38.    As a result of its implementation of ASU 2011-02, Orrstown disclosed in its Q2 
2011 Form 10-Q that approximately $34 million of restructured loans qualified as TDRs. 
However, at least $22 million of these loans were restructured in 2010 and were thus outside of 
ASU 2011-02’s retroactive scope. 

       39.    Barton was responsible for Orrstown’s implementation of ASU 2011-02 and 
knew or should have known that retroactive application of this pronouncement to restructurings 
that occurred prior to January 1, 2011 was not in accordance with GAAP. 

       40.    Additionally, Quinn, Everly and Embly knew or should have known that 
Orrstown was not permitted to retroactively apply ASU 2011-02 to restructurings before January 
1, 2011. Nonetheless, Quinn, Everly, and Embly participated in and agreed to the decision to 
apply ASU 2011-02 to loans that were restructured in 2010, inconsistent with GAAP. 

   B.  Loan Losses Were Not Calculated in Accordance with GAAP 

       41.    In connection with Orrstown’s recognition of approximately $34 million of TDRs 
in Q2 2011, Barton performed an impairment analysis to determine if impairment losses needed 
to be recorded for any of these TDRs – which, under GAAP are deemed impaired loans. 

       42.    For a majority of the $34 million in loans, Barton utilized a discounted cash flow 
model (“DCF Model”) to calculate impairment losses. But rather than using the expected future 
cash flows and each loan’s effective interest rate in his DCF Model, as required by GAAP, 
Barton used each loan’s contractual cash flows which he then discounted at a “market rate” to 
arrive at the net realizable value of the loans. This approach did not comply with ASC 310-10-
35-22. 

       43.    On or around September 2, 2011, Barton informed Quinn, Everly and Embly that 
this methodology was “not technically within the accounting rules” but none of them took any 
action to alter the DCF Model to conform to GAAP.

   C.  Orrstown Utilized Stale Real Estate Appraisals in Calculating Fair Value Measurements 
       for Collateral Securing Certain Commercial Loans 

       44.    As described above, during Q2 and Q3 2010, when the Bank performed an 
impairment analysis on certain classified loans, its analysis did not comply with its loan policy 
because it utilized stale real estate appraisals. Moreover, the Bank’s analysis did not comply with 
GAAP because it incorporated inappropriate inputs into its collateral valuation models. 

       45.    During Q2 and Q3 2010, Orrstown relied upon stale appraisals aged in excess of 
two years when calculating impairment losses on certain of its commercial loans. Orrstown’s 
reliance upon stale real estate appraisals ran counter to its own loan policy, which required that 
all real estate loans be supported by current appraisals that were no more than two years old in a 
stable real estate environment and no more than “a few months” old in a “rapidly escalating or 
deteriorating market.” Despite these requirements, and the declining real estate and broader 
economic market throughout 2010, Orrstown did not obtain current real estate appraisals or 
reliable real estate appraisal updates on many of its loans, including those issued to Lending 
Relationships A, B and C. 

       46.    For example, during Q2 and Q3 2010, Orrstown evaluated approximately $42.3 
million and $49.2 million of “Substandard” rated loans for impairment loss, respectively. For Q2 
2010, approximately 40% of those loans were supported by real estate appraisals older than two 
years and 14% of those loans were supported by real estate appraisals older than five years. For 
Q3 2010, approximately 29% of those loans were supported by real estate appraisals older than 
two years and 10% were supported by real estate appraisals older than five years. 

       47.    Additionally, in Q2 and Q3 2010, Orrstown utilized the fair value of collateral to 
measure impairment loss on certain commercial loans individually evaluated for impairment. 
GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and 
provides a framework for measuring fair value in ASC 820. According to ASC 820, fair value 
measurements are to be based on, among other things, inputs that a market participant would 
incorporate into its valuation model as of the applicable measurement date. 

       48.    During Q2 and Q3 2010, however, contrary to GAAP, Orrstown estimated the 
current value of its real estate collateral by relying on stale real estate appraisals and discounted 
the appraised values by a universal discount rate regardless of the age of the appraisal. The 
discount was based primarily on a regulatory study conducted in 2004 which had no bearing on 
the current real estate market as of 2010 and was irrelevant to the collateral valuation model as of 
Q2 and Q3 2010. 

       49.    As members of the Loan Committee, Quinn, Everly and Embly were ultimately 
responsible for ensuring that each loan was supported by updated information and Embly, in 
particular, was ultimately responsible for regulatory compliance regarding appraisals. Moreover, 
Quinn, Everly and Embly knew or should have known that the Bank’s use of stale appraisals in 
connection with the measurement of impairment loss, and its use of a universal discount rate, did 
not comply with GAAP and Orrstown’s own loan policy.

---------------------Page 11---------------------

                 Orrstown Did Not Devise and Maintain a Sufficient System of  
                                 Internal Accounting Controls 

       50.    During the Relevant Period, Orrstown did not maintain a system of internal 
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions were recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Orrstown’s 
lack of internal accounting controls resulted in: (1) incorrect loan risk ratings; (2) incorrect 
disclosures of impaired loans; (3) incorrect calculations and disclosures of loan losses; (4) 
incorrect application of newly issued accounting pronouncements; and (5) the lack of action to 
remedy accounting problems after being alerted to them. 

       51.    Quinn, Everly and Embly were ultimately responsible for the timely 
identification, evaluation and reporting of impaired loans. 

       52.    As President and CEO, Quinn was responsible for the administration of 
Orrstown’s loan policy. He was a member of the Loan Committee, Executive Committee and 
Board of Directors. As principal executive officer of Orrstown, Quinn was responsible for 
certifying in its periodic filings that Orrstown had adequate internal controls to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with GAAP. 

       53.    As CFO, Everly was responsible for ensuring that Orrstown’s financial reporting 
was materially accurate, complete and prepared in accordance with GAAP. He was a member of 
the Loan Committee and Executive Committee and regularly attended meetings of the Board of 
Directors. As principal financial officer of Orrstown, Everly was responsible for certifying in its 
periodic filings that Orrstown had adequate internal controls to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with GAAP. 

       54.    As CCO, Embly was responsible for credit underwriting, loan work out and loan 
administration, including supervision of the loan review process and ensuring that material 
adverse information concerning borrowers was timely incorporated into the loan ratings. He was 
a member of the Loan Committee and Executive Committee and regularly attended meetings of 
the Board of Directors. 

       55.    Quinn, Everly and Embly were members of committees that reviewed borrowers’ 
requests for loan modifications and, in the course of those meetings, received information 
regarding the borrowers’ financial difficulties. 

       56.    Barton was responsible for overseeing the finance department in coordinating 
financial reporting and preparing monthly financial reports to senior management and the Board 
of Directors. He was also responsible for implementing new accounting pronouncements and 
ensuring that Orrstown’s accounting policies were consistent with GAAP. Barton drafted the 
disclosure pertaining to the early adoption of ASU 2011-02 in the Q2 2011 Form 10-Q and 
performed the calculation of loan loss reserves for the loans that were classified as TDRs in Q2 
2011.

                  Orrstown Issued Securities During the Relevant Time Period 

       57.    Orrstown offered securities in 2010 pursuant to a Form S-8 that it originally filed 
on April 11, 2000 and again offered securities in 2011 pursuant to a Form S-8 that it filed on 
June 3, 2011. The Form S-8 filed on April 11, 2000 incorporated by reference all subsequent 
periodic filings under the Exchange Act for securities sold under this registration statement. 
Thus, it incorporated by reference Orrstown’s Q2 and Q3 2010 Forms 10-Q, which materially 
under-reported the Bank’s impaired loans. The Form S-8 filed on June 3, 2011 incorporated by 
reference Orrstown’s 2010 Form 10-K and its Q1 2011 Form 10-Q and all subsequent periodic 
filings under the Exchange Act for securities sold under this registration statement. Thus, it 
incorporated by reference Orrstown’s Q2 and Q3 2011 Forms 10-Q and its 2011 Form 10-K, 
which also materially under-reported the Bank’s impaired loans. 

                                        VIOLATIONS 

       58.    Securities Act Section 17(a)(2) prohibits any person from obtaining money or 
property in the offer or sale of securities by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or 
any omission to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  

       59.    Securities Act Section 17(a)(3) prohibits any person from engaging in any 
transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit 
upon the purchaser in the offer or sale of securities.  

       60.    Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder require that 
every issuer of a security registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 file with the 
Commission, among other things, such annual and quarterly reports as the Commission may 
require. 

       61.    Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 requires that, in addition to the information expressly 
required to be included in a statement or report filed with the Commission, there shall be added 
such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in 
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 

       62.    Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 requires an issuer’s principal executive and principal 
financial officer to certify each periodic report containing financial statements filed by an issuer 
pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. 

       63.    Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) requires reporting companies to make and 
keep books, records and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
transactions and dispositions of their assets. 

       64.    Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires all reporting companies to devise 
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets.

       65.    Rule 13b2-1 under the Exchange Act prohibits any person from, directly or 
indirectly, falsifying or causing to be falsified, any book, record, or account subject to 
Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A). 

       66.    As a result of the conduct described above, Orrstown violated Securities Act 
Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) and Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), 
and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. 

       67.    As a result of the conduct described above, Quinn violated Securities Act Sections 
17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3), and Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 13b2-1, and caused Orrstown to 
violate Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 
13a-13 thereunder. 

                                                                              2
       68.    As a result of the conduct described above, Everly willfully       violated Securities 
Act Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3), and Exchange      Act Rules 13a - 14 and 13b2 - 1, and caused 
Orrstown to violate Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Rules 12b        -
20, 13a- 1 and 13a- 13 thereunder.  

       69.     As a result of the conduct described above, Embly violated Securities Act 
Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3), Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and caused Orrstown to violate 
Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 
thereunder. 

       70.    As a result of the conduct described above, Barton violated Exchange Act Rule 
13b2-1 and caused Orrstown to violate Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 
13(b)(2)(B), and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13. 

       71.    As a result of the conduct described above, Everly also willfully violated the 
federal securities laws or rules and regulations thereunder pursuant to Section 4C of the 
Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 

                            ORRSTOWN’S REMEDIAL EFFORTS 

       72.    In determining to accept Orrstown’s Offer, the Commission considered remedial 
acts promptly undertaken by Orrstown and cooperation afforded the Commission staff. 

                                                 IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest 
to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondents’ Offers. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 8A

        A willful violation of the securities laws means merely “‘that the person charged with the duty knows what 
he is doing.’” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977

                             Respondent’s work in his practice before the Commission will be 
                             reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public 
                             company for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, 

                                              15

                              as long as he practices before the Commission in this capacity; 
                              and/or 

                ii.    An independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the 
                      Commission that: 

                          1.  Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
                              associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting 
                              Oversight Board (“Board”) in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley 
                              Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective;  

                          2.  Respondent, or the registered public accounting firm with which he 
                              is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection 
                              did not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in the 
                              respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would 
                              indicate that the respondent will not receive appropriate 
                              supervision;  

                          3.  Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and 
                              has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions 
                              imposed by the Board (other than reinstatement by the 
                              Commission); and  

                          4.  Respondent acknowledges his responsibility, as long as 
                              Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an 
                              independent accountant, to comply with all requirements of the 
                              Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
                              requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring 
                              partner reviews and quality control standards. 

       K.     The Commission will consider an application by Respondent Everly to resume 
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and 
he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy. 
However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission 
will consider an application on its other merits. The Commission’s review may include 
consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to the 
applying Respondent’s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or 
practice before the Commission. 

       L.     Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall 
be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To 
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor 
Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction 
of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondents’ payment of a 
civil penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants 
such a Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final 

                                               16

order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the 
amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall 
not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the 
civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor 
Action” means a private damages action brought against any Respondent by or on behalf of one 
or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the 
Commission in this proceeding. 

                                               V. 

       It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in 
Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and 
admitted by Respondents Orrstown, Quinn, Everly, Embly and Barton and further, any debt for 
civil penalty or other amounts due by each of the aforementioned Respondents under this Order 
or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in 
connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by said Respondents of the federal 
securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 
523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19). 

       By the Commission.
