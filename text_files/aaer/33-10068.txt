       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act 
of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange 
Act”), against Ener1, Inc., Charles L. Gassenheimer, Jeffrey A. Seidel, and Robert R. Kamischke 
(collectively “Respondents”).   
 
                                         II. 
 
      In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers

---------------------Page 2---------------------

of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to 
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as 
to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are 
admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V., Respondents consent to the entry of this 
Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 
1933 and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a 
Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below. 
 
                                                III. 
 
                                                                                  1
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds     that:  

                                            Summary 

        Ener1, Inc. was formerly a NASDAQ-listed U.S. company that designed, manufactured, 
and developed lithium ion batteries for transportation, grid energy, and consumer products.  Ener1 
committed violations of the federal securities laws resulting in materially overstated earnings and 
assets for year-end 2010 as well as the first quarter of 2011.  It did so by: (1) not impairing at year-
end 2010 its investments in the equity of an unconsolidated related-party entity of which it had 
48% voting rights; (2) improperly recognizing revenue from sales of batteries to that entity during 
the fourth quarter of 2010; and (3) not properly assessing the collectability of its loan and accounts 
receivables from that entity to determine whether those assets were impaired at year-end 2010 and 
end of the first quarter of 2011.  Ener1 materially misstated its financial statements because its 
management did not appropriately analyze the impairment issues and because senior management 
did not communicate certain facts relevant to an impairment analysis to Ener1’s accounting staff 
and external auditor.  Ener1 lacked sufficient procedures and staff to determine the relevant U.S. 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) as well as accounting internal controls to 
obtain necessary information to apply GAAP.  In the course of the foregoing, Respondents 
committed various violations of the federal securities law as cited herein. 

                                           Respondents 

       1.      Ener1, Inc. (“Ener1”) was, at all relevant times, headquartered in New York with 
offices in Indiana and Florida (was a Florida corporation, founded in 1985) and was a public, US-
based company that designed, manufactured and developed lithium ion batteries for transportation, 
grid energy, and consumer products.  On December 2, 2011, the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC, 
filed a Form 25 notice of delisting of Ener1’s common stock from the NASDAQ market and 
terminating its registration obligation under Section 12(b) pursuant to Section 12(d) of the 
Exchange Act.  On January 26, 2012, Ener1 filed for bankruptcy.  On March 30, 2012, Ener1 filed 
a Form 15 notice of deregistration of its securities from registration under Section 12(g) and 
suspension of duty to file reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.  As of that day, 
it emerged from bankruptcy as a private company.

 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding on any other 
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.   
 
                                                 2  
---------------------Page 3---------------------

       2.     Charles L. Gassenheimer (“Gassenheimer” or “Respondent”), age 42, of Glen 
Head, New York, was at all times relevant the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Board 
Chairman of Ener1.  He became an Ener1 Director in 2006, Board Chair in 2007, and CEO in 
2008.  Gassenheimer also became the CEO and Director of Ener1 Group, Inc.  As CEO, 
Gassenheimer signed the certifications associated with Ener1’s Form 10-K for the year-ended 
December 31, 2010 and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. 

       3.     Jeffrey A. Seidel (“Seidel” or “Respondent”), age 53, of New Canaan, 
Connecticut, was Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of Ener1 from September 2010 to October 
2011.  Seidel joined Ener1 as Vice President for Corporate Strategy in 2008 and became Ener1’s 
Chief Strategy Officer in January 2010.  Seidel has never been a CPA.  As CFO, Seidel signed the 
certifications associated with Ener1’s Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2010 and the 
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. 

       4.     Robert R. Kamischke (“Kamischke” or “Respondent”), age 61, of Fenton, 
Michigan, was the Chief Accounting Officer (“CAO”) of Ener1 and CFO of Ener1 subsidiary, 
EnerDel, Inc., from September 2010 to July 2011.  Kamischke has never been a CPA.  Kamischke 
had joined Ener1 in November 2008 as Controller of the Ener1 subsidiary, EnerDel, Inc. and 
focused on implementing project controls, budget, planning, and cost systems.  As CAO, 
Kamischke signed the certifications associated with Ener1’s Form 10-K for the year-ended 
December 31, 2010 and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. 

                                    Other Relevant Parties 

       5.     Think Holdings, AS, a private Norwegian limited liability company, was majority 
owner of Think Global, AS (which are collectively referred to as “Think”).  Think Global was an 
electric car manufacturer.  Think filed for bankruptcy protection in 2006 and again in 2008.  It 
emerged from the 2008 bankruptcy in 2009 through a debt settlement entered into by Ener1, a 
third-party contract manufacturer for Think, a Norwegian government investment fund, and others.  
After its emergence from bankruptcy, Gassenheimer became a Think Holdings, AS, Director in 
2009 and Think Holdings Board Chairman in 2010.  On June 22, 2011, Think Global again filed 
for bankruptcy.   

                                           FACTS  

   A.  The Financial Statements Contained in Ener1’s 2010 Form 10-K Did Not Conform with 
       GAAP 

       6.     During the period relevant to this Order, January 1, 2010 through June 22, 2011 
(“Relevant Period”), Ener1 was a manufacturer of lithium batteries for various purposes including 
electric cars.  During this time, one of its largest customers was Think, a manufacturer of electric 
cars.  Ener1 not only supplied batteries to Think but also had voting rights for almost 50% of its 
equity and held loan and accounts receivables from Think.  In its Form 10-K for the year-ended 
December 31, 2010 filed on March 10, 2011, Ener1 reported an equity investment in Think of 
$58.6 million, which represented 15 percent of Ener1’s $396.5 million in total assets, and 48% 
voting interest in Think; accounts receivable from Think of $13.6 million ($8.5 mm past due), 
which represented three percent of Ener1’s assets; loans receivable from Think totaling $14.0 

                                               3  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

million, which represented 3.5 percent of Ener1’s assets; and sales to Think of $18.8 million, 
representing 24% of Ener1’s 2010 revenue of $77 million.  

       7.     At December 31, 2010, as described above, Ener1’s investment in Think was $58.6 
million, Ener1’s accounts receivable from Think was $13.6 million, Ener1’s loans receivable from 
Think was $14.0 million and sales to Think were $18.8 million.  On March 10, 2011, Ener1 filed 
its Form 10-K for 2010.  Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke signed the Form 10-K and 
provided certifications pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

       8.     The financial statements contained in Ener1’s 2010 Form 10-K did not conform 
with GAAP in several ways thereby causing material misstatements in the 2010 Form 10-K 
concerning Ener1’s financial results.  The financial statements did not conform with GAAP 
because Respondents did not take into account the deteriorating financial condition of Think as 
detailed below when determining whether to impair the assets associated with Think as well as the 
revenue derived from sales to Think.    

   1.  Think’s Deteriorating Financial Condition 

       9.     Ener1 had purchased Think B shares in several tranches at Norwegian Kroner 
(“NOK”) 10 per share, the last of which had been purchased by May of 2010.  The May 2010 
financing was projected to “fully finance” Think until the end of 2010.  However, during the third 
week of September, 2010, Think informed Gassenheimer, who was serving as Think’s Chairman 
and Ener1’s CEO at the time, that the company’s previous estimates regarding cash and inventory 
were inaccurate.  Instead of $14.3 million in cash projected to be on hand as of September 2010, 
Think had negative $2 million, and instead of $13.6 million in inventory, the company had $24.4 
million due to accounting errors and mistakes in accounting for inventory.   

       10.    Due to its cash constraints, Think could not pay creditors.  Think sought immediate 
funding from prior investors, including Ener1, through two rounds of funding in September and 
December of 2010, which ultimately fell short of covering Think’s financial needs.  In 2010, Think 
had also retained an investment firm “to act as its lead placement agent in connection with the sale 
of its equity or equity-linked securities.”  Due in part to Think’s cash issues, the investment firm 
postponed its efforts to introduce Think to possible investors until January 2011.     

       11.    On January 12, 2011, Ener1 management emailed Think management (copied to 
Kamischke, Seidel, and Gassenheimer) a memo that required Think to present a “thorough and 
credible plan” for Think’s immediate operations and cash management.  On January 14, 2011, as 
the plan Ener1 had requested, the so-called “90 day plan,” was presented to Think’s Board, 
including Gassenheimer.  The 90 day plan included receiving a $10 million bridge loan from 
Ener1, selling more cars, cutting expenses, negotiating supplier payment suspensions, and 
“rais[ing] $50-70 million at whatever valuation it [could] get.”  At that time Seidel and Kamischke 
agreed that Ener1 could not provide the $10 million in additional financing that Think had 
requested from Ener1.  On February 11, 2011, a representative of the investment firm addressed 
Think’s Board at a meeting that both Gassenheimer and Seidel attended, and stated that the 
probability of raising $50 million would be greater with a low per-share valuation, describing a 
potential capital raise as “valuation sensitive.” 

                                                4  
---------------------Page 5---------------------

       12.    By January 20, 2011, Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke received an interim 
report by Think’s auditor (“Think Auditor Report”) that described multiple controls and financial 
reporting deficiencies and stated that Think may “risk threats to the going concern assumption” if 
management did not continue to “focus on securing the companies’ income, control of expenses 
and ensuring adequate liquidity.”  On January 21, 2011, Think’s auditor sent a letter to the Think 
Board, including Gassenheimer, stating that it was aware that the December fundraising efforts had 
been unsuccessful, and warned the directors that if the company could not make payments when 
due, and the equity fell to less than half of the capital, the directors had an obligation, with 
attendant criminal liability, under Norwegian law, to dissolve the company.   

       13.    In a January 31, 2011 email drafted by Seidel, Gassenheimer, and the Ener1 COO, 
the Ener1 board was informed of the following: 1) existing Think investors had not funded Think 
adequately; 2) Ener1 had sent Think $2.8 million in January 2011 in order for Think to cover its 
current payroll obligations; and 3) Think had $30 million in payables to Ener1 and other suppliers, 
and a maximum of $15.5 million potential gross proceeds in finished and near finished goods.  
Ener1 did not include this information in board minutes provided to its auditors.   

       14.    On February 2, 2011, a party related to an existing Think investor submitted a 
preliminary proposal for a term sheet with a target raise of $20 million of Think B shares at NOK 2 
per share.  Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke received a copy of the preliminary term sheet 
proposal.  During the 2010 year-end audit, Ener1’s auditors were never provided with a copy of the 
proposal or otherwise made aware of its terms.   

       15.    Think’s 90-day plan included obtaining a $10 million bridge loan from Ener1.  
However, Seidel and Kamischke determined that Ener1 could not provide that additional 
financing.  During a February 5, 2011 Think Board meeting (a meeting attended by Seidel and 
Kamischke), Gassenheimer proposed the additional bridge financing.  In response, Seidel 
explained in an email to Gassenheimer (copied to Kamischke) that Ener1 was not in a financial 
position to fund a $10 million bridge loan to Think, adding that Think sales had not increased and 
the car’s bill of materials cost had not decreased.    

       16.    By early February 2011, Ener1’s budget projections assumed that Ener1 would not 
receive payments from Think, and Ener1 would not sell any more batteries to Think in 2011.  On 
February 15, 2011, the COO and Kamischke presented a revised budget to the Ener1 Board (a 
meeting attended by Gassenheimer and Seidel), showing “meager Think sales” and an “inability to 
collect” on Think receivables.   

       17.    Because of Think’s inability to pay the third party that actually manufactured its 
cars (“third-party manufacturer”), at the beginning of February 2011, Think and its third-party 
manufacturer negotiated a four-week production shut down.  On February 20, Think informed its 
third-party manufacturer that it was suspending operations and payments to all suppliers for sixty 
days.  As a result, beginning in early February 2011, although the third-party manufacturer may 
have completed some cars already in process, it did not manufacture new cars.

   2.  Not Applying Properly Impairment Factors as to Ener1’s Equity Investment in Think 
       Resulted in a $58.6 Million Overstatement.   
 
       18.    As described above in the Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2011, Ener1 reported an 
equity investment in Think of $58.6 million.  Ener1 had purchased Think B shares in several 
tranches recorded at NOK 10 per share, the last of which it purchased in May of 2010.  Ener1’s 
equity investment in Think B shares was recorded at cost because the form of the investment was 
not deemed to be equivalent to common stock for accounting purposes.  See FASB Accounting 
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 325.  As part of preparing its financial statements to be included 
in its Form 10-K, Ener1’s accounting staff undertook an analysis (“Impairment Memo”) to 
determine whether, and if so, to what amount Ener1’s $58.6 million equity investment in Think 
was impaired pursuant to ASC 320, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities.  The accounting 
staff did so because Ener1’s investment in Think was a material part of the balance sheet. 

       19.    Ener1’s equity investment in Think B shares was recorded at cost because the form 
of the investment was not deemed to be equivalent to common stock for accounting purposes.  For 
investments held at cost, such as Ener1’s investment in Think, GAAP requires that the reporting 
entity evaluate whether an event or  change in circumstances has occurred in that period that may 
have had an adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.  GAAP impairment indicators 
include, but are not limited to: 1) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit 
rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; 2) a significant adverse change in the 
regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee; 3) a significant adverse change 
in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee 
operates; 4) a bona fide offer to purchase (whether solicited or unsolicited), an offer by the investee 
to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar security for an amount less than the 
cost of the investment; and/or 5) factors that raise significant concerns about the investee's ability 
to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working capital 
                                                                                     2
deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or debt covenants.  

       20.    In the Impairment Memo, prepared by Ener1’s accounting department and 
reviewed by Seidel and Kamischke, the company concluded that Ener1’s investment in Think was 
not impaired as of December 31, 2010 because no impairment factors were present.  Ener1’s 
accounting staff provided this memorandum to Ener1’s auditors as support of its decision to 
continue carrying its investment in Think at cost.   

       21.    However, contrary to the conclusion in the Impairment Memo, Respondents were 
aware of information that should have indicated that a change of circumstances had occurred that 
had an adverse effect on the fair value of Ener1’s investment in Think from the time of purchase 
such that the equity investment should have been impaired.  In fact, by the time that Ener1 filed its 
Form 10-K, Think had: 1) softer than expected sales; 2) considered raising funds at “whatever 
valuation”; 3) a cessation of production of cars; 4) a lack of cash to pay creditors or maintain 
operations; 4) a preliminary going concern from its auditors; 5) a preliminary offer;  6) failed to 
pay its loans from Ener1 when due and payable; and 7) failed to pay for batteries shipped to it by 

                                                 
2
 See FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320-10-35-27. 
                                                 6  
---------------------Page 7---------------------

      3
Ener1.    These impairment indicators ,  should have necessitated Ener1 impairing its $58.6 million 
equity investment in Think as of December 31, 201    0 ,  instead of Ener 1 incorrectly reporting it as an 
                                   4
impairment as of March 31, 2011    .     

    3.  Not Conducting an Impairment Analysis as to Loans Receivable Such that Loans 
        Receivable Were Overstated by $ 14 Million at Year-End. 
 
        22.     In its Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2011, Ener1 reported that its loans receivable 
from Think totaled $14.0 million, which represented 3.5 percent of Ener1’s assets.  It found that 
the loans receivable did not require impairment because Ener1 concluded, based on a minimal 
analysis in the Impairment Memo without any citation to the relevant accounting literature, that the 
loans receivable were not impaired. 

        23.     However, under GAAP, a loss from receivables must be recorded when both of the 
following conditions are met: 1)”[i]nformation available before the financial statements are issued 
or are available to be issued… indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired at the 
                                                                                                   5
date of the financial statements,” and 2) “[t]he amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. ”   

        24.     Ener1 made the following loans in late 2010 when Think was already in significant 
financial distress: 1) an October 1, 2010 $5 million loan, due December 31, 2010 that Think never 
repaid nor did it make any interest payments required by the terms of the loan; 2) an October €1 
million loan paid directly to the third-party manufacturer so it would continue producing cars on 
behalf of Think, which was never repaid; and 3) a November 18, 2010, $5 million line of credit to 
Think (exhausted by December 2010), due on January 21, 2011 that was never repaid.  Despite 
Think’s desperate need for cash, and its failure to pay any interest on the outstanding loans 
receivable, Ener1 did not conduct any analysis as to the likelihood that the loans receivable was 
impaired.  In fact, Ener1 did not have specific written procedures by which to assess the 
impairment of loans.  By not impairing the loans receivable as of December 31, 2010, Ener1 
overstated its assets by $14 million or 3.5 percent of its total assets.   

    4.  Not Conducting an Impairment Analysis as to Accounts Receivable Resulted in an 
        Overstatement of $13.6 million in Accounts Receivable.   
 
        25.     For purposes of the 2010 year-end audited financial statements included in Ener1’s 
Form 10-K, Ener1’s accounts receivable from Think were recorded at $13.6 million ($8.5 mm past 
due), which represented 3.4 percent of Ener1’s assets.  Ener1 concluded, based a short analysis in 
the Impairment Memo without any citation to the relevant accounting literature, that the accounts 
receivable were not impaired as of December 31, 2010.   

                                                 
3
 None of these facts were included in the Impairment Memo.  Instead, the Impairment Memo represented that 
original investment had not deteriorated, car sales were strong, Think continued to sell its shares at NOK 10, and 
there was no going concern regarding Think because it would be able to raise additional funds through financing. 
4
 As discussed below, the company issued a Form 8-K in August 2011, recognizing that it should have impaired its 
equity investment in think as of year-end 2010.   
5
 See ASC 310-10-35-8. 
                                                   7

       26.    Under GAAP, a loss from receivables must be recorded when both of the following 
conditions are met: 1)”[i]nformation available before the financial statements are issued or are 
available to be issued… indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired at the date of 
                                                                                        6
the financial statements,” and 2) “[t]he amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. ”  Think 
made its last payment for batteries received from Ener1 in mid-September 2010, although Ener1 
continued to ship batteries and record revenue through January 2011.  By November 2010, Think 
owed Ener1 $4.5 million from batteries already shipped, and Ener1 accounting personnel including 
Kamischke were concerned regarding the non-payment.  Despite that concern, Ener1’s accounting 
staff did not perform any collectability analysis as to whether the accounts receivable might be 
impaired.  In fact, Ener1 did not have specific written procedures by which to assess the 
impairment of accounts receivable.  By not impairing the accounts receivable as of December 31, 
2010, Ener1 misstated its assets by over 3 percent. 

   5.  Not Determining Whether Fourth Quarter 2010 Think-Related Revenue Should Have 
       Been Recognized Caused 14% Revenue Overstatement  

       27.    For purposes of the audited year-end financial statements included in the 2010 
Form 10-K, Ener1 recognized $18.8 million in revenue in connection with the shipment of 
batteries to Think.  Although Ener1 lacked a formal written revenue recognition policy, Ener1 
disclosed in its Form 10-K that to recognize revenue it must determine that that there was 
                                                                     7
reasonable assurance of collectability for revenue to be recognized.   Here, because of the 
deteriorating condition of Think, as detailed above, Ener1 did not perform the analysis for 
sufficient reasonable assurance that it would be able to collect on the revenue recognized from its 
shipment of batteries to Think during the fourth quarter of 2010.  By recognizing revenue from that 
quarter, Ener1’s revenue was overstated by 14% ($77 million reported would become $66 million 
as adjusted). 

       28.    In its year-end 2010 Form 10-K, Ener1 disclosed that as of January 2011, it 
“temporarily stopped” sending batteries to Think at its direction “until the company rebalanced its 
overall inventory levels.”  Gassenheimer reiterated this reason in a March 10, 2010 conference call.  
By the time of the filing of the Form 10-K and the conference call, Think was also experiencing a 
severe operational and financial deterioration, was undertaking a restructuring plan, and had also 
negotiated a shutdown with its third-party manufacturer because it could not pay the manufacturer.   

   B.  Events Subsequent to the Filing of the 2010 Form 10-K 

       29.    Subsequent to the filing of Form 10-K, Think’s financial condition continued to 
deteriorate.  By the end of March, Think was unable to pay payroll taxes, its investment banker had 
been unable to find any willing investors, and its CFO, after consulting with Seidel, sent an email 
to Gassenheimer, among others, recommending that Think seek court-ordered liquidation.  By 

                                                 
6
 See ASC 310-10-35-8.    
7
 ASC 605-10-25-1 provides that revenue may be properly recognized only when it is both a) realized or 
recognizable and b) earned.  See also Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13, Revenue Recognition, which provides that 
revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive 
evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the seller’s price to 
the buyer is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.   
                                                  8  
---------------------Page 9---------------------

April, Gassenheimer emailed the Ener1 Board indicating that Think was in need of restructuring 
because its past due payables exceeded $50 million.   

       30.    Throughout March and April 2011, Gassenheimer and Seidel, with the assistance of 
the Ener1 accounting staff, formulated various organization and ownership scenarios, all of which 
contemplated Ener1 contributing its Think-related assets in exchange for an interest in a joint 
venture, that would include Think’s third-party manufacturer and Ener1’s largest shareholder, to 
take ownership of Think.  None of those scenarios provided for Ener1 to recover 100 percent of its 
reported amount of its equity investment and/or receivables in Think.  The scenarios also failed to 
account for the payment, either in cash or interest in a joint venture, of Think’s other equity 
investors or trade creditors other than the third-party manufacturer.   

       31.    On April 17, 2011, the Think Board considered a liquidation analysis/going 
concern analysis performed by Think’s investment banker (“liquidation analysis”).  The analysis 
concluded that Think would be worth $10-15 million in liquidation and it would require a $135 to 
$150 million capital investment to remain as a going concern.  Seidel received the liquidation 
analysis and an invitation to the Board meeting from Gassenheimer.  Seidel sent the liquidation 
analysis to Kamischke.   

   C.  Ener1’s Form 10-Q for the  First Quarter of 2011 Contained Financial Statements that 
       Did Not Conform with GAAP  

       32.    Ener1 did not impair its Think loans or accounts receivable, based upon the 
assertion that those amounts would be recovered in the joint venture.  On April 29, Seidel, in an 
email to Gassenheimer challenged the recoverability of the receivables given the percentages of 
ownership in the joint venture, and the amount of financial contribution by other joint venture 
partners as compared with the total amount of Ener1 receivables.  Gassenheimer replied that the 
capital commitments from the joint venture partners still needed to be negotiated. 

       33.    On May 10, 2011, Ener1 filed its Form 10-Q for the First Quarter of 2011.  
Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke each signed and certified the filing.  In its Form 10-Q, 
although Ener1 disclosed that the Think investment was impaired, and recorded an impairment loss 
of approximately $59.4 million (100%) during the three months ended March 31, 2011, “primarily 
due to the uncertainty of when or if Think Global will recommence operations…” it did not impair 
the accounts receivable or loans receivable.  In the filing, Ener1 stated that impairment was 
unnecessary because management believed it would realize full value, “which may include our 
receipt of equity or other value in connection with a potential equity restructuring of Think 
Holdings.”  

       34.    Think filed for bankruptcy on June 22, 2011, and on the same day, Ener1 
announced that it would take a material charge for the Think receivables.  In a Form 8-K filed on 
August 10, 2011, Ener1 stated that its year-end 2010 Form 10-K and first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q 
should not be relied upon, and that Ener1 would restate its filings.  Specifically, the Company 
stated that it would amend its 2010 year-end Form 10-K and its first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q for 
the quarter ended March 31, 2011 to restate its financial statements to reflect, as of December 31, 
2010, the impairments of its investment in Think (which had previously been recorded in the first 
quarter of 2011), its Think accounts receivable and its Think loans receivable including accrued 

                                                9  
---------------------Page 10---------------------

interest, as well as reflect the corrected accounting for revenue recognized in connection with 
transactions with Think during the year ended December 31, 2010 and the three months ended 
March 31, 2011. Ultimately, Ener1 did not file a restatement, and in January 2012, it filed for 
bankruptcy protection. 

    D.  Accounting and Internal Accounting Controls Environment at Ener1 

        35.     It was of central importance for those responsible for financial reporting and 
internal controls at Ener1 to have a command of GAAP.  It was also important that the accounting 
staff received the requisite information to determine that Think-related assets and revenue were 
properly stated in accordance with GAAP given the significance of Think to the financial 
statements of Ener1.   

        36.      Ener1 had numerous deficiencies throughout its system of internal accounting 
controls that were attributable, in part, to its failure to understand and assess the risks in its control 
environment.  First, Ener1 lacked procedures to ensure that the geographically dispersed 
accounting personnel received necessary information generally and specifically, as it related to 
                                    8
Ener1’s relationship with Think.        Second, it did not maintain  a sufficient complement of personnel 
with the requisite level of accounting knowledge, experience       , and training in the application of 
GAAP.  Finally   , Ener1  did not have specific   documented    accounting proce   dures as to: 1) when and 
how to conduct an impairment analysis as to any equity held by the company; 2) determining the 
collectability of loans receivable  ; 3) determining the collectability of accounts    receivable  ;  and  4) 
the recognition of revenue.    Gassen  heimer, Seidel, and Kamischke       did not ensure that Ener1 had 
these requisite procedures in place to ensure that the books and records were properly maintained, 
and ultimately that the financial statements disclosed in public filings would be in accordance w          ith 
GAAP.     

        37.      Ener1 lacked any specific procedures regarding information distribution to the 
accounting staff.  Instead, the accounting staff shared information through weekly telephone calls, 
and some members of the accounting staff routinely received Ener1 board minutes while others did 
not.  Specifically, as to Think, while Gassenheimer, Seidel and Kamischke received significant 
information regarding Think such as Think board minutes and Think board presentations, they did 
not have a specific documented procedure so that the accounting staff responsible for financial 
reporting received necessary information.  Respondents did not ensure that pertinent information 
with respect to Ener1’s investment in and transactions with Think were identified, captured, and 
communicated in a form and time frame sufficient to enable finance and accounting personnel to 
carry out their responsibilities.    

        38.     Respondents Seidel and Kamischke lacked expertise in accounting to assess the 
information obtained regarding Ener1’s exposure to Think.  Neither Seidel nor Kamischke was a 
CPA.  Furthermore, Seidel and Kamischke were new to their roles and had never been responsible 
for a public company’s financial reporting.  Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke did not ensure 
                                                 
8
 Ener1’s accounting function was dispersed among three locations located in New York, Florida, and Indiana.  
Seidel worked in the NY corporate office with Gassenheimer while Kamischke and the Controller worked at a 
manufacturing and research facility in Indianapolis.  Meanwhile, the Director for Financial Reporting worked in the 
Florida office and only worked full time during the reporting season.  Also located in the Florida office was the 
Director of Internal Controls.    
                                                      10

that Ener1 had a sufficient complement of personnel with the requisite level of accounting 
knowledge, experience, and training.    

   E.  Sales of Ener1 Treasury Securities 

       39.    Ener1 sold 2,858,357 shares of Ener1 treasury securities on the open market 
between January 25, 2011 through June 3, 2011, for gross proceeds of $9,452,577 at a time when 
Ener1’s financial statements were materially inaccurate, and Think’s operational and financial 
                                     9
deterioration had not been disclosed.    The shares were sold to provide funding for Ener1’s 
operations and to pay quarterly interest on senior unsecured notes.   

                                             Violations  

       40.    Section 17(a)(2) makes it unlawful to obtain money or property through 
misstatements or omissions about material facts; and Section 17(a)(3) proscribes any transaction or 
course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a purchaser of 
securities.  SEC v. Softpoint, Inc., 958 F. Supp. 846, 861 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), aff’d, 159 F.3d 1348 (2d 
Cir. 1998).  Only negligence is required for liability under Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3).  Aaron v. 
SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 697 (1980). 

       41.    Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to file such periodic and other 
reports as the Commission may prescribe and in conformity with such rules as the Commission 
may promulgate.  Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require the filing of annual and quarterly 
reports, respectively.  In addition to the information expressly required to be included in such 
reports, Rule 12b-20 of the Exchange Act requires issuers to add such further material information, 
if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under 
which they are made not misleading. “The reporting provisions of the Exchange Act are clear and 
unequivocal, and they are satisfied only by the filing of complete, accurate, and timely reports.”

report is shown to contain materially false or misleading information. SEC v. Kalvex, Inc., 425 F. 
Supp. 310, 316 (S.D.N.Y. 1975).  No showing of scienter is necessary to establish an issuer’s 
violation of Section 13(a).  SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978).   

       42.    Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to “make and keep books, 
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the issuer.”  Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers 
to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurances that transactions are recorded to permit the preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  No showing of scienter is necessary to 
establish violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B).  SEC v. World-Wide Coin 
Investments, 567 F. Supp. 724, 749-51 (N.D. Ga. 1983).

 The sales took place pursuant to a Form S-3 shelf registration that Ener1 filed (Gassenheimer signed) and that 
became effective on February 5, 2009.  Shares were taken off the shelf, and the S-3 was updated with a Form 424 
filed on January 25, 2010 in connection with an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies & Company, Inc. 
(“Jefferies”) to sell up to $60 million of treasury securities.  The agreement with Jefferies prohibited sales during 
blackouts and in the event of material adverse changes based on Ener1’s insider trading policies.

or causing to be falsified any book, record, or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the 
Exchange Act.  Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2(a)(2) provides that no director or officer of an issuer 
shall, directly or indirectly, omit to state, or cause another person to omit to state, any material fact 
necessary in order to make statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such 
statements were made, not misleading, to an accountant in connection with financial-statement 
audits, reviews, or examinations or the preparation or filing of any document or report required to 
be filed with the Commission. No showing of scienter is required to establish a violation of Rules 
13b2-1 or 13b2-2.  World-Wide Coin, 567 F. Supp. at 749; Promotion of the Reliability of

       44.    Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, Certification of Disclosure in Annual and Quarterly 
Reports, requires each Form 10-Q and 10-K to include certifications signed by each principal 
executive and principal financial officer of the issuer (or persons performing similar functions).  
Among other things, the certifying officers must confirm that the report does not contain any 
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements 
made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with 
respect to the period covered by the report.  

                                            Findings  

       45.    Based on the foregoing the Commission finds that Respondent Ener1 violated 
Securities Act Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) and Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 
13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. 

       46.    Based on the foregoing, the Commission further finds that: (1) Respondents 
Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke violated Securities Act Sections 17(a)(2) and (3), and 
Exchange Act Rule 13a-14; (2) Respondents Seidel and Kamischke violated Exchange Act Rule 
13b2-1 and Rule 13b2-2; and (3) Respondents Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke caused 
Ener1’s violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange 
Act Rules12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents’ Offer. 
 
           A.  Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities 
       Act and Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondents Ener1, Gassenheimer, Seidel and 
       Kamischke shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future 
       violations of Securities Act Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) and Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 
       13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  Respondents 
       Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke shall cease and desist from committing or causing 
       any violations and any future violations of Rule 13a-14.  Respondents Seidel and 
       Kamischke shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future 
       violations of Exchange Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.

   F.  Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be 
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes.  To 
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents Gassenheimer, Seidel, and 
Kamischke agree that in any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they are 

                                        13

       entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory 
       damages by the amount of any part of Respondent Gassenheimer’s, Seidel’s or 
       Kamischke’s payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset").  If the court in any 
       Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents Gassenheimer, Seidel, 
       and Kamischke agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the 
       Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the 
       Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Such a payment shall not be 
       deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the 
       civil penalty imposed in this proceeding.  For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related 
       Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondents 
       Gassenheimer, Seidel and Kamischke by or on behalf of one or more investors based on 
       substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this 
       proceeding.

       It is further Ordered that for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section 523 of 
the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by 
Respondents Gassenheimer, Seidel and Kamischke and further, any debt for disgorgement, 
prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other amounts due by Respondents Gassenheimer, Seidel, 
and Kamischke under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement 
agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Respondents 
Gassenheimer, Seidel, and/or Kamischke of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order 
issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 
§523(a)(19).
