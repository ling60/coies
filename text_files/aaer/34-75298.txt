        In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers 
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings 
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents consent 
to the entry of this Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings 
Pursuant to Section 4C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 203(k) of the Investment 
Advisers Act  of 1940, and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings,

                                              SUMMARY 
 
        1.      This proceeding arises out of Respondents’ failure to complete surprise 
examinations pursuant to Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder (the

 Section 4C provides, in relevant part, that:  
The Commission may censure any person, or deny, temporarily or permanently, to any person the 
privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission in any way, if that person is found . . . (1) not 
to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others . . . (2) to . . . have engaged in . . . improper 
professional conduct; or (3) to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any 
provision of the securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 
2
 Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provides, in pertinent part, that: 
The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing

“Custody Rule”) in 2009, 2010, and 2011.     Professional Investment Management,   Inc. (“PIM”), a 
registered investment adviser, had custody of client assets held in three omnibus accounts at all 
relevant times and was required by the Custody Rule to engage an independent public accountant 
to conduct annual surprise examinations to verify those assets.  PIM engaged the Firm to perform 
these required annual surprise examinations from 1999 to 2011.  Respondents completed the 
surprise examinations on an annual basis from 1999 to 2008.  However, Respondents failed to 
complete the surprise examinations (i.e., conduct fieldwork, prepare and issue a surprise 
examination report, and file Form ADV-E with the Commission) or withdraw from the surprise 
examinations in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and, thus, caused PIM to violate the Prior Custody Rule or 
the Custody Rule, as applicable, for each of those years.  In addition, Wilson engaged in improper 
professional conduct, within the meaning of Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) 
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, in connection with the surprise examinations from 2009 
through 2011.

       2.      Michael S. Wilson, age 61, has been a certified public accountant (“CPA”) 
licensed by the Ohio Board of Accountancy since June 9, 1980.  Wilson is a 50% shareholder of 
the Firm, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, was the engagement partner for the services 
that the Firm performed for PIM, which included, as relevant to this proceeding, annual surprise 
examinations required by the Prior Custody Rule and the Custody Rule.  Wilson has never been 
subjected to any disciplinary or regulatory proceedings. 
        
       3.      Cotterman-Wilson CPAs, Inc. is a Columbus, Ohio-based accounting firm 
established in 1997 that has five full-time employees: two CPAs who each are 50% shareholders of 
the Firm, a CPA who is not a shareholder of the Firm, and two administrative personnel.  The Firm 
primarily provides accounting and tax services to individuals and private entities.  The Firm has 
never been registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and has never been 
subjected to any disciplinary or regulatory proceedings.

 On December 30, 2009, the Commission adopted amendments to the Custody Rule, which became 
effective March 12, 2010.  See Custody of Funds or Securities of Clients by Investment Advisers, Release 
No. IA-2968 (Dec. 30, 2009).  Respondents’ conduct in 2009 was governed by the Custody Rule in effect 
before the December 30, 2009 amendments (the “Prior Custody Rule”).  See Custody of Funds or 
Securities of Clients by Investment Advisers, Release No. IA-2176 (Sept. 25, 2003).  The significant 
differences between the Custody Rule and the Prior Custody Rule, as relevant to this specific proceeding, 
are described below in Paragraph 11.

owned by Douglas E. Cowgill (“Cowgill”), Owner A, and Owner B.  PIM was registered with the 
Commission as an investment adviser from 1978 through September 30, 2013, and from June 24, 
2014 to today.  PIM provides third-party administration services and investment advisory services 
to approximately fifteen retirement plan clients (which consist of approximately 325 participants 
who, in turn, own approximately 425 individual retirement accounts that PIM advises), and also 
provides investment advisory services to approximately twenty-five individual clients for their own 
(non-retirement plan) accounts.  PIM has approximately $120 million of regulatory assets under 
management, and has custody of client assets through three omnibus accounts.  PIM is the only 
SEC registrant that the Firm or Wilson has ever had as a client. 
 
                                             FACTS 
        
       5.     The Commission filed suit against Cowgill and PIM in the United States District 
Court for the Southern District of Ohio on April 29, 2014 alleging that Cowgill and PIM violated 
the antifraud provisions of the U.S. securities laws, and that PIM violated, and Cowgill aided and 
abetted and caused PIM’s violations of, the registration provisions of the Advisers Act, the Prior 
Custody Rule, and the Custody Rule.  The Commission filed an Amended Complaint on August 7, 
2014 that included additional counts against Cowgill and PIM, and the Court entered a Judgment 
by Consent against Cowgill on August 21, 2014 as to all counts asserted in the Amended 
Complaint.  The Commission alleged that PIM and Cowgill hid a shortfall of more than $700,000 
in client assets by sending false account statements to clients. 
        
       6.     At all relevant times, PIM maintained client funds in an omnibus checking account 
held on an agency basis at Custodian 1, and client securities in two omnibus accounts held on an 
agency basis at Custodian 2 and Custodian 3.  All client funds were initially deposited into the 
omnibus checking account held at Custodian 1, and then were transferred for investment to various 
firms, including Custodians 2 and 3. 
 
       7.     PIM maintained records for the omnibus accounts held at Custodians 1, 2, and 3 on 
a client level (i.e., PIM kept track of the assets in these accounts on a client-by-client basis), and 
sent directly to its clients periodic (typically quarterly) account statements that it generated based 
upon its own internal records.  
        
       8.     However, neither Custodian 1, Custodian 2, nor Custodian 3 maintained records for 
the omnibus accounts on a client level (indeed, none of these custodians was privy to PIM’s client 
information), and neither Custodian 1, Custodian 2, nor Custodian 3 sent quarterly account 
statements to any of PIM’s clients. 
        
       9.     The Custody Rule requires, and the Prior Custody Rule required, registered 
investment advisers with custody of client funds or securities, like PIM, to implement certain 
controls designed to protect those client assets from loss, misappropriation, misuse, or the adviser’s 
insolvency. 
        

                                                  
                                                4 
                                                  
---------------------Page 5---------------------

       10.    Specifically, the Prior Custody Rule required registered investment advisers to 
either: (i) have a reasonable basis for believing that a “qualified custodian,” such as a bank or 
broker-dealer, was sending quarterly account statements to each of the clients for which they 
maintained funds or securities; or (ii) send the quarterly account statements themselves and obtain 
an annual surprise examination by an independent public accountant to verify all of the client funds 
and securities.   
        
       11.    The Custody Rule amended the Prior Custody Rule by, among other things, 
requiring all registered investment advisers with custody of client funds or securities  to undergo an 
annual surprise examination by an independent public accountant to verify all of the client funds 
and securities, regardless of whether such advisers had a reasonable basis for believing that a 
“qualified custodian,” such as a bank or broker-dealer, was sending quarterly account statements to 
                                                                  5
each of the clients for which they maintained funds or securities.  
        
       12.     PIM thus was obligated in 2009 under the Prior Custody Rule to have the client 
assets held in omnibus accounts at Custodians 1, 2, and 3 verified through surprise examination 
by an independent public accountant because none of these custodians sent quarterly account 
statements directly to PIM’s clients (and PIM did not have a reasonable basis for believing that they 
did so), and also was obligated in 2010 and 2011 under the Custody Rule to have the client assets 
held in omnibus accounts at Custodians 1, 2, and 3 verified through surprise examination by an 
independent public accountant because PIM had custody of those assets. 
 
                             PIM Engaged the Firm to Perform the 
                          2009, 2010, and 2011 Surprise Examinations 
        
       13.    PIM engaged the Firm to complete PIM’s surprise examinations for the periods of 
time ending April 30, 2009 (the “2009 Exam”), April 30, 2010 (the “2010 Exam”), and May 31, 
2011 (the “2011 Exam”). 
        

                                                 
5
 As reflected in Rule 206(4)-2(a)(4), the Custody Rule also amended the Prior Custody Rule to require 
all surprise examinations be conducted pursuant to a written agreement between the adviser and the 
accountant that explicitly requires the accountant to: (i) file Form ADV-E with the Commission within 
120 days of the time chosen by the accountant stating that it has examined the client funds and securities 
and describing the nature and extent of the examination; (ii) notify the Commission within one business 
day of its finding any material discrepancies; and (iii) file Form ADV-E within four business days of 
resignation or dismissal from, or other termination of the engagement, along with a statement that 
includes, among other things, the date of such resignation, dismissal, removal, or other termination, and 
an explanation of any problems that contributed to such resignation, dismissal, removal, or other 
termination.  The Custody Rule thus established a new contractual reporting obligation for accountants 
regarding their resignation or dismissal from, or other termination of the engagement, and established a 
120-day deadline by which surprise examinations must be completed.

---------------------Page 6---------------------

       14.    Owner A, on behalf of PIM, engaged the Firm on or about May 28, 2009 to 
perform the 2009 Exam by signing a three-page letter in which the Firm represented, among other 
things, that: 
        
               We will examine management’s assertion, included in the 
               Management Statement Regarding Compliance with Certain 
               Provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Act), that 
               Professional Investment Management, Inc. (the Company) 
               complied with certain provisions of rules 204-2(b) and 206(4)-2 of 
               the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as of April 30, 2009 and 
               during the period June 1, 2008 to April 30, 2009.  The Company is 
               responsible for compliance with the requirements of the [A]ct.  
               Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s 
               assertion about the Company’s compliance based on our 
               examination. 
                
               Our examination will be conducted in accordance with attestation 
               standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public 
                                               6
               Accountants [(“AICPA”)]. . . . . 
 
       15.    PIM also engaged the Firm to perform the 2010 and 2011 Exams.   
        
       16.    Wilson was the sole CPA on each of the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams, and was 
solely responsible for completing the planning and fieldwork, supervising the two non-CPAs 
who performed largely ministerial work on these exams, issuing a report or choosing to withdraw 
from the engagement, and ensuring that Form ADV-E was filed with the Commission for each of 
the years for which the Firm was engaged by PIM to perform a surprise examination. 
                                                  
                  Respondents’ 2009 Exam Report Lacks Reasonable Basis 
        
       17.    Respondents performed field work in connection with the 2009 Exam.  Indeed, the 
Firm sent invoices to PIM reflecting the work it had performed, and PIM paid each of these 
invoices in full. 
 

                                                 
6
 The AICPA attestation standards applicable to surprise examinations performed pursuant to the Prior 
Custody Rule and the Custody Rule are set forth in AT Section 101, “Attest Engagements” and AT 
Section 601, “Compliance Attestation.”  See, e.g., Commission Guidance Regarding Independent Public 
Accountant Engagements Performed Pursuant to Rule 206(4)-2 Under the Investment Advisers Act of 
1940, Release No. IA-2969 (Dec. 30, 2009).  This December 30, 2009 interpretative guidance had not 
been published at the time that PIM engaged the Firm to perform the 2009 Exam, but was published prior 
to both the date that the Firm issued its report for the 2009 Exam and the dates that PIM engaged the Firm 
to perform the 2010 and 2011 Exams. 

                                                  
                                                6 
                                                  
---------------------Page 7---------------------

       18.    Respondents signed a final report for the 2009 Exam on or about July 27, 2010, 
which provides the following opinion: 
        
               We have examined management’s assertion, included in the 
               accompanying Management Statement Regarding Compliance with 
               Certain Provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, that [PIM] 
               complied with certain provisions of rules 204-2(b) and 206(4)-2 of the 
               Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as of and during the period ended April 
               30, 2009. 
                
                                                   *  *  * 
                
               In our opinion, management’s assertion that [PIM] complied with the 
               requirement of subparagraphs (1) of rule 206(4)-2(a) under the Investment 
               Advisers Act of 1940 as of April 30, 2009, and has complied with rule 
               204-2(b) and the requirements of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of rule 206(4)-
               2(a) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as of and during the 
               period from June 1, 2008 through April 30, 2009, is fairly stated, in all 
               material respects. 
        
       19.    Respondents’ opinion lacks reasonable basis for two reasons: 
        
               a.  First, AT Section 601.11 requires an accountant to obtain a written assertion as 
                   part of engagement performance.  Respondents, however, did not obtain a 
                   management assertion upon which their opinion is purportedly based.  Wilson 
                   knew that AT Section 101 requires a conclusion that a scope limitation exists 
                                                                        7
                   if the accountant fails to obtain a written assertion, and necessitates a 
                   decision to provide a qualified opinion, to disclaim an opinion, or to 
                             8
                   withdraw.     
        
               b.  Second, Respondents identified material variances, as of April 30, 2009, in the 
                   records of certain of PIM’s client securities-holding accounts.  Wilson sent a 
                   fax to Cowgill on May 12, 2010 that identified these variances and directed 
                   Cowgill to call Wilson to discuss, but Respondents’ workpapers do not show 
                   that Respondents obtained evidence to explain these variances or otherwise 
                   reconcile these variances.  Respondents thus lacked sufficient evidence to 
                   provide a reasonable basis for issuing a report containing an opinion that

                 management’s assertion that PIM complied with the Prior Custody Rule was 
                 fairly stated, in all material respects.  See AT Section 101.51.   
        
              Respondents Failed To File Form ADV-E With The Commission 
                            In Connection With The 2009 Exam 
 
       20.    Respondents failed to file Form ADV-E with the Commission in connection with 
the 2009 Exam.  The Prior Custody Rule obligated the adviser to require the accountant to file with 
the Commission Form ADV-E within 30 days of completing the surprise examination in order for 
the adviser to comply with the Prior Custody Rule.  Respondents never filed Form ADV-E in 
connection with the 2009 Exam. 
                                               
                Respondents Failed To Complete The 2010 and 2011 Exams,  
                 Did Not Timely Withdraw From These Engagements, and 
    Never Filed Form ADV-E With The Commission In Connection With These Exams 
                                   
       21.    Respondents were aware at the time that PIM engaged them to perform the 2010 
Exam that the Prior Custody Rule had been amended by the Custody Rule, and understood that 
the Custody Rule obligated the adviser to require the accountant to file Form ADV-E with the 
Commission within 120 days from the date that the accountant had begun the surprise 
examination in order for the adviser to comply with the Custody Rule. 
        
       22.    Respondents had never completed a surprise examination for PIM in less than 120 
days.  For instance, the surprise examination reports prepared in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 
2009 were prepared 391, 414, 213, 247, and 453 days after the commencement of each 
respective surprise examination. 
        
       23.    Nevertheless, Respondents accepted the engagement for the 2010 Exam.  
        
       24.    By all accounts, Respondents performed field work in connection with the 2010 
Exam.  PIM did not cooperate with Respondents’ requests for information in connection with the 
2010 Exam, but Respondents did not terminate the engagement.  Instead, Respondents sent 
periodic invoices to PIM reflecting the work they had performed.  PIM paid each of these 
invoices in full. 
        
       25.    Sometime in 2011 Wilson informed at least one PIM owner that Respondents 
would be unable to complete the 2010 Exam within 120 days from the date that they had begun 
the 2010 Exam.  In response, a PIM owner proposed that Respondents begin the 2011 Exam, 
complete the fieldwork that was necessary to complete both the 2010 and 2011 Exams, and then 
simultaneously file Form ADV-E with the Commission for the 2010 and 2011 Exams. 
        

                                               
                                              8 
                                               
---------------------Page 9---------------------

       26.    Respondents agreed to this proposal, accepted the engagement for the 2011 Exam, 
and began simultaneously performing field work in connection with both the 2010 and 2011 
Exams. 
                                                    
       27.    PIM did not cooperate with Respondents’ requests for information in connection 
with the 2010 and 2011 Exams, but Respondents did not terminate the engagement for either of 
these examinations.  Instead, the Firm sent invoices to PIM reflecting the work it had performed 
in connection with these examinations, sending the last of such invoices to PIM on or about 
October 30, 2011.  PIM paid each of these invoices in full. 
        
       28.    Respondents never issued a report for either the 2010 or 2011 Exam, did not 
timely withdraw from the engagements to conduct these examinations and notify PIM of their 
decision to withdraw, and never filed Form ADV-E with the Commission in connection with 
either of these examinations.  See AT Section 101.64 (“The practitioner who accepts an attest 
engagement should issue a report on the subject matter or the assertion or withdraw from the attest 
engagement.”); AT Section 101.39 (requiring accountant to exercise “due professional care” in the 
planning and performance of the engagement and the preparation of the report); AT Section 601.38 
(requiring accountant to exercise “due care” in planning and performing an examination 
engagement). 
 
       29.    It was not until January 11, 2013, more than 15 months after submitting their last 
invoice to PIM in connection with the 2010 and 2011 Exams, that Respondents notified PIM that 
they did not intend to perform any additional services for PIM. 
 
       30.    Months later, Owner A and Owner B asked Respondents to resume performing 
surprise examinations for PIM.  Respondents declined this request. 
        
   Respondents Caused PIM’s Violations of the Custody Rule and the Prior Custody Rule 
        
       31.    Respondents caused PIM’s violation of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and 
Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder. 
        
       32.    Wilson was the engagement partner for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams, and was 
the only CPA to perform work in connection with these exams.  Respondents agreed to perform 
the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams, and understood that PIM had engaged them to: (i) conduct the 
2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams; (ii) verify funds and securities through actual examination; and 
(iii) file with the Commission Form ADV-E within the time periods required by the Prior 
Custody Rule and the Custody Rule. 
        
        
        
        
        

                                                
                                               9 
                                                
---------------------Page 10---------------------

       33.    With respect to the 2009 Exam, Respondents failed to: 
        
               a.  obtain a reasonable basis for issuing a report containing an opinion that 
                   management’s assertion that PIM complied with the Prior Custody Rule was 
                   fairly stated, in all material respects, because they failed to obtain: 
                    
                       i.  a management assertion; and 
                           
                      ii.  sufficient evidence to support such an opinion; and 
                    
               b.  file Form ADV-E with the Commission. 
        
       34.    With respect to the 2010 Exam, Respondents failed to: 
 
               a.  complete the examination or withdraw from the engagement and notify PIM 
                   of such withdrawal on a timely basis; and 
        
               b.  file Form ADV-E with the Commission. 
        
       35.    With respect to the 2011 Exam, Respondents failed to: 
                    
               a.  complete the examination or withdraw from the engagement and notify PIM 
                   of such withdrawal on a timely basis; and 
        
               b.  file Form ADV-E with the Commission. 
 
                   Respondents Engaged in Improper Professional Conduct 
 
       36.    Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provide that the 
Commission may censure or temporarily or permanently deny an accountant the privilege of 
appearing or practicing before it if it finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the 
accountant engaged in “improper professional conduct.”  Rule 102(e)(1)(iv) and Section 4C(b) 
define “improper professional conduct” to include: (1) “intentional or knowing conduct, 
                                                                                           9
including reckless conduct, that results in a violation of applicable professional standards” ; or 
(2) negligent conduct in the form of: (i) “a single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that 
results in a violation of applicable professional standards in circumstances in which [an 
accountant] knows, or should know, that heightened scrutiny is warranted”; or (ii) “repeated 

                                                 
9
 The Commission defines recklessness under Rule 102(e) to be the same as recklessness under the 
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws: conduct which is an extreme departure from the 
standards of ordinary care.  See Amendment to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 63 Fed. 
Reg. 57164, 57167 (Oct. 26, 1998).

instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation of applicable professional 
                                                                                  10
standards, that indicate a lack of competence to practice before the Commission.”  
        
       37.    During the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams, Respondents engaged in the following 
improper professional conduct: 
        
               a.  Respondents failed to file Form ADV-E with the Commission in connection 
                  with the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams.  See AT Section 101.39 (requiring 
                  accountant to exercise “due professional care” in performing engagement); 
                  AT Section 601.38 (requiring accountant to exercise “due care” in performing  
                  engagement). 
                   
               b.  Respondents failed to complete the 2010 and 2011 Exams or withdraw from 
                  these engagements and notify PIM of such withdrawals on a timely basis.  See 
                  AT Section 101.64 (“The practitioner who accepts an attest engagement 
                  should issue a report . . . or withdraw from the attest engagement.”). 
 
               c.  Respondents issued a report containing an unqualified opinion in connection 
                  with the 2009 Exam in contravention of AT Section 101’s and AT Section 
                  601’s requirements that they obtain a management assertion from PIM in 
                  order to do so.  See AT Section 101.58 (“When the practitioner’s client is the 
                  responsible party, a failure to obtain a written assertion should result in the 
                  practitioner concluding that a scope limitation exists.”); AT Section 601.11 
                  (“[T]he practitioner should obtain from the responsible party a written 
                  assertion . . . .”). 
                   
               d.  Respondents lacked a reasonable basis to conclude in their 2009 Exam report 
                  that management’s assertion that PIM complied with the Prior Custody Rule 
                  was fairly stated, in all material respects, because they identified material 
                  variances in the records of certain of PIM’s client securities-holding accounts, 
                  but did not obtain evidence to explain these variances or otherwise reconcile 
                  these variances.  See AT Section 101.51. 
 
       38.    Findings 
 
               a.     Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondents caused 
                      violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2 
                      thereunder by Professional Investment Management, Inc.

  Rule 102(e)(1)(iv) describes improper professional conduct with respect to persons licensed as 
accountants; Section 4C(b) describes improper professional conduct with respect to any registered public 
accounting firm or associated person.

---------------------Page 12---------------------

 
              b.      Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondents engaged in 
                      improper professional conduct pursuant to Section 4C(a)(2) of the 
                      Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of 
                      Practice. 
                                                 
                                              IV. 
                                                 
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents’ Offers. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED pursuant to Section 4C of the Exchange Act, Section 
203(k) of the Advisers Act, and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice effective 
immediately, that: 
       A.     Respondents shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and 
any future violations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2 promulgated 
thereunder.  
 
       Wilson  
        
       B.     Respondent Wilson is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the 
Commission as an accountant.   
 
       C.     Respondent Wilson shall, within ten (10) days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil 
money penalty in the amount of $50,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission.   If timely 
payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3717.  Payment must 
be made in one of the following ways:   
 
              (1)     Respondent Wilson may transmit payment electronically to the 
                      Commission, which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire 
                      instructions upon request;  
        
              (2)     Respondent Wilson may make direct payment from a bank account via 
                      Pay.gov through the SEC website at 
                      http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or  
               
              (3)     Respondent Wilson may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or 
                      United States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and 
                      Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

       The Firm 
 
       D.      Respondent Firm is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the 
Commission as an accountant.   
 
       E.      After three years from the date of this order, Respondent Firm may request that 
the Commission consider its reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of 
the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as: 
      
               1.     a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or 
                      review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with 
                      the Commission.  Such an application must satisfy the Commission that 
                      Respondent Firm’s work in its practice before the Commission will be 
                      reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company 
                      for which it works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as it 
                      practices before the Commission in this capacity; and/or 
 
               2.     an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
                      Commission that: 
      
                      (a)     Respondent Firm, or the public accounting firm with which it is 
                              associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting 
                              Oversight Board (“Board”) in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley 
                              Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
                      (b)     Respondent Firm, or the registered public accounting firm with 
                              which it is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that 
                              inspection did not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in 
                              the respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would 
                              indicate that the respondent will not receive appropriate 
                              supervision; 

                      (c)     Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and 
                              has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions 

                                                  
                                               13

                             imposed by the Board (other than reinstatement by the 
                             Commission); and 
 
                      (d)    Respondent acknowledges his/her responsibility, as long as 
                             Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an 
                             independent accountant, to comply with all requirements of the 
                             Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
                             requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring 
                             partner reviews and quality control standards.   
 
       F.     The Commission will consider an application by Respondent Firm to resume 
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that its state CPA license is current and 
it has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.  
However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission 
will consider an application on its other merits.  The Commission’s review may include 
consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to 
Respondent Firm’s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or 
practice before the Commission. 
        
       G.     Respondent Firm shall, within ten (10) days of the entry of this Order, pay to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission: (i) a civil money penalty in the amount of $25,000; (ii) 
disgorgement in the amount of $10,868, which represents profits gained as a result of the conduct 
described  herein;  and  (iii)  prejudgment  interest  of  $1,029.    If  timely  payment  is  not  made, 
additional interest shall  accrue pursuant  to  31 U.S.C. § 3717  and  SEC  Rule of Practice 600.  
Payment must be made in one of the following ways: 
 
              (1)     Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which 
                      will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;  
        
              (2)     Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov 
                      through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or 
        
              (3)     Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United 
                      States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange 
                      Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:  
 
                             Enterprise Services Center 
                             Accounts Receivable Branch

       Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying 
Respondent Firm as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a 
copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Paul Montoya, Associate 
Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, Chicago Regional 
Office, 175 West Jackson Boulevard, Suite 900, Chicago, IL 60604-2908.   
 
        I.      Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, a Fair 
Fund is created for the disgorgement, interest and penalties referenced in paragraphs IV.C and 
IV.G, above.  Regardless of whether any such Fair Fund distribution is made, amounts ordered to 
be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the 
government for all purposes, including all tax purposes.  To preserve the deterrent effect of the 
civil penalty, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they 
are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages 
by the amount of any part of Respondents’ payment of a civil penalty in this action (“Penalty 
Offset”).  If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents 
agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify 
the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission.  Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and 
shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding.  For 
purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a private damages action brought 
against any or both of the Respondents by or on behalf of one or more investors based on 
substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this 
proceeding. 
        
                                                V. 

       It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section 
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by 
Respondents, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other 
amounts due by Respondents under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree 
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by 
Respondents of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set 
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(19). 

 
       By the Commission.
