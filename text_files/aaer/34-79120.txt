A.     RESPONDENT 

       David A. Aronson, CPA, age 56, of North Miami, Florida, is a certified public accountant 
licensed in the state of Florida.  Aronson has functioned as an accountant to Company A and 
Company B, from at least October 2, 2015 to approximately February 2016.  From March 2005 
through October 2, 2015, Aronson was the sole proprietor of a Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board (“PCAOB”)-registered public accounting firm and was engaged as Company A’s  
auditor from 2013 through July 2015, and as Company B’s auditor from 2011 through June 2015.  
Aronson consented to a PCAOB order dated October 2, 2015 pursuant to which he was barred 
from being an associated person of a registered public accounting firm.   

B.     FACTS 

       1.     ARONSON’S UNLAWFUL ASSOCIATION 

              a.  Section 105(c)(7)(B) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) 
                  states that it is “unlawful for any person that is ... barred from being associated 
                  with a registered public accounting firm [...] willfully to become or remain 
                  associated with any issuer […] in an accountancy or financial management 
                  capacity [...] without the consent of the [PCAOB] or the Commission.”   

              b.  On October 2, 2015, the PCAOB filed a settled action against Aronson and his 
                  firm, David A. Aronson, CPA, for multiple deficiencies in audit work 
                  performed between 2011 and 2015 on several public company engagements, 
                  including Company B (the “PCAOB Order”).  The PCAOB Order, which was 
                  and is available on its website, revoked the registration of his accounting firm 
                  and barred Aronson from being an associated person of a registered public 
                  accounting firm.   

              c.  Company A is a Delaware corporation and at all relevant times its common 
                  stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the 
                  Exchange Act. 

              d.  Company B is a Nevada corporation and at all relevant times its common stock 
                  was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange 
                  Act. 

              e.  Aronson continued to perform accountancy or financial management services 
                  after the PCAOB Order for Company A until February 2016, including, but not 
                  limited to, preparing Company A’s financial statements, and the notes to the 
                  financial statements, and preparation of the company’s Management Discussion 
                  & Analysis section for its Form 10-Q for the period ended November 30, 2015. 

              f.  Additionally, after the PCAOB Order was issued, Aronson continued to 
                  perform accountancy or financial management services for Company B until 
                  February 2016, including, but not limited to, preparing Company B’s financial 
                  statements and the notes to the financial statements for its Form 10-Q for the 

                                               2 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

                  period ended September 30, 2015 and preparation of the financial statements for 
                                                                                     3
                  Company B’s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015.  

               g.  Aronson received payment for accountancy or financial management work he 
                  performed despite having been barred by the PCAOB. 
                    
               h.  Aronson never requested or received consent from the PCAOB or the 
                  Commission to remain associated with Company A or Company B in this 
                  accountancy or financial management capacity.   

        2.     VIOLATION 

       As a result of the conduct described above, Aronson willfully violated Section 105(c)(7)(B) 
of Sarbanes-Oxley, which prohibits a person barred from associating with a registered public 
accounting firm from willfully becoming or remaining associated with an issuer in an accountancy 
or financial management capacity without consent of the PCAOB or the Commission.  

                                               III. 

       In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it 
appropriate that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be instituted to determine: 

       A.      Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection 
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;  

       B.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent should be 
ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of 
Section 105(c)(7)(B) of Sarbanes-Oxley. 

       C.      Whether, pursuant to Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Aronson should be censured or denied, temporarily or 
permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant;    

       D.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21B of the Exchange Act, civil penalties should be 
levied against Respondent; and 
        
       E.      Whether, pursuant to Sections 21B and 21C of the Exchange Act, Aronson should 
be subject to disgorgement with prejudgment interest. 

                                               IV. 

       IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for purposes of taking evidence on the questions set 
forth in Section III hereof shall be convened not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from 
service of this Order at a time and place to be fixed and before an Administrative Law Judge to be 

                                                 
3
       Company B terminated Aronson as its accountant on February 10, 2016 prior to the filing of its 2015 Form 
10-K.

designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 
C.F.R. § 201.110.   
        
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations 
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220 
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220. 
        
       If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly 
notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against 
him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as 
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.  
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310. 
 
       This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent as provided for in the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice.   
 
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of the Commission’s Rules 
of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2), the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial 
decision no later than 120 days from the occurrence of one of the following events:  (A) The 
completion of post-hearing briefing in a proceeding where the hearing has been completed; (B) 
Where the hearing officer has determined that no hearing is necessary, upon completion of 
briefing on a motion pursuant to Rule 250 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 
201.250; or (C) The determination by the hearing officer that a party is deemed to be in default 
under Rule 155 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.155 and no hearing is 
necessary.   
        
       In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged 
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related 
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness 
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice.  Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within 
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the 
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action. 
        
       By the Commission.
