C.     FACTS 
        
                                           Overview 
 
        
       10.    Morgan Asset, through Kelsoe, as Portfolio Manager, managed the Helios Select 
Fund, Inc., the Helios High Income Fund, Inc., the Helios Multi-Sector High Income Fund, Inc., 
the Helios Strategic Income Fund, Inc., and the Helios Advantage Income Fund, Inc. (collectively, 
the Funds) from at least November 2004 through July 29, 2008.   
        
       11.    Respondent Morgan Keegan, a registered broker-dealer and registered investment 
adviser, was the principal underwriter and distributor of shares of the open-ended Funds.  Each of 
the Funds Boards of Directors was responsible for pricing the Funds securities in accordance with 
the Funds valuation policies and procedures (valuation procedures).  Although the Funds 
prospectuses stated that Morgan Asset would price the securities, each Funds Board of Directors 
delegated the pricing responsibility to Morgan Keegan.  Morgan Keegan priced each Fund s 
securities and calculated the Funds daily net asset value2
                                                        (NAV) through its Fund Accounting 
Department (Fund Accounting).   Weller was an officer and treasurer of the Funds.  Weller, 
Morgan Keegans Controller, along with other Morgan Keegan personnel, staffed a Valuation 
Committee that oversaw Fund Accountings processes and evaluated the prices assigned to 
securities.  Morgan Keegan and Weller failed to adequately fulfill Morgan Keegans 
responsibilities, as delegated to it by the Funds Boards of Directors, to price the Funds securities 
in accordance with their valuation policies and procedures regarding valuation.  For example, at 
various times from January 2007 through July 2007, Fund Accounting accepted unsubstantiated 
price adjustments, submitted by Kelsoe, that inaccurately inflated the prices of certain securities, 
contrary to the Funds valuation procedures.  Fund Accounting failed to document justifications for 
such pricing adjustments.   
        
       12.    The Funds valuation policies and procedures required the comparison of fair 
values to prices provided by other sources. Pursuant to that requirement, Fund Accounting 
periodically obtained broker-dealer price confirmations for certain fair valued securities.  
Unbeknownst to Fund Accounting and the Funds independent auditor (Independent Auditor), 
the Portfolio Manager, Kelsoe, actively screened and influenced a broker-dealer to change the 
price confirmations that Fund Accounting and the Independent Auditor obtained from the broker-
dealer. Kelsoe also failed to advise Fund Accounting or the Funds Boards of Directors when he 
received information indicating that the Funds prices for certain securities should be reduced.

       The net asset value or NAV of an investment company is the companys total assets 
minus its total liabilities.  An investment company calculates the NAV of a single share (or the 
per share NAV) by dividing its NAV by the number of shares that are outstanding. 
 
                                               4 
                                                 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

       13.     Each of the Funds held, in varying amounts, securities backed by subprime 
mortgages, and the market for such securities deteriorated in the first half of 2007.  Morgan 
Keegan utilized practices which were not reasonably designed to determine that the Funds NAVs 
were accurate. Morgan Asset, through Kelsoe, engaged in actions that forestalled declines in the 
NAVs of the Funds that would have occurred as a result of the deteriorating market, absent his 
intervention.   
                                                  
       14.     Many of the securities that were held by the Funds and backed by subprime 
mortgages lacked readily available market quotations and, as a result, were required by the 
Investment Company Act to be priced by   the Funds Boards of Directors, using fair value 
methods.  Under Section 2(a)(41)(B) of the Investment Company Act, the Funds were required to   
use market values for portfolio securities with readily available market quotations and use fair 
value for all other portfolio assets, as determined in good faith by the board of directors.  The fair 
value of securities for which market quotations are not readily available is the price the Funds 
would reasonably expect to receive on a current sale of the securities.3
                                                                        
 
              15. The Funds adopted valuation procedures for pricing the Funds portfolio securities 
and assigned the task of following those procedures to Morgan Keegan. The Funds valuation 
procedures for fair-valued securities mandated that such securities should be valued in good faith 
by the Valuation Committee, considering a series of general and specific factors including, among 
others, fundamental analytical data relating to the investment, an evaluation of the forces which 
influence the market in which the securities are purchased or sold and events affecting the 
security.  The procedures required the Valuation Committee to maintain a written report 
documenting the manner in which the fair value of a security was determined and the accuracy of 
the valuation made based on the next reliable public price quotation for that security.  The 
procedures also required that values assigned to securities be periodically validated through, 
among other means, broker-dealer price confirmations.  Fund Accounting also used broker-dealer 
price confirmations to set current values. The procedures specified that prices obtained from a 
broker-dealer could only be overridden when there was a reasonable basis to believe that the price 
provided [did] not accurately reflect the fair value of the portfolio security.  Whenever a price was 
overridden, the procedures mandated the basis for overriding the price to be documented and 
provided to the Valuation Committee for its review.   
 
       16.     In filings with the Commission, the Funds stated that the fair value of securities 
would be determined by Morgan Assets Valuation Committee using procedures adopted by the 
Funds board of directors.  In fact, the responsibility was delegated to Morgan Keegan, which 
primarily staffed the Valuation Committee.  Morgan Keegan   and the Valuation Committee did not 

                                                 
3
       See AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide - Investment Companies (Sect. 2.35-2.39), 
which incorporates Accounting Series Release No. 118 (ASR 118). The Commission has 
provided interpretative guidance related to financial reporting in the Accounting Series Releases, 
which is included in the Codification of Financial Reporting Policies. Thus, conformity with the 
ASR 118 is required by Commission rules and complies with Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (GAAP). See also  Articles 1 -01(a) and 6.03 of Regulation S-X.    
                                                5 
                                                 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

reasonably satisfy their responsibilities under the Funds procedures in several ways.  Among other 
things: (i) the Valuation Committee left pricing decisions to lower level employees in Fund 
Accounting who did not have the training or qualifications to make fair value pricing 
determinations; (ii) Fund Accounting personnel relied on Kelsoes price adjustments to 
determine the prices assigned to portfolio assets, without obtaining a reasonable basis for or 
documentation supporting the price adjustments or applying the factors set forth in the procedures; 
(iii) Fund Accounting personnel gave Kelsoe discretion beyond the parameters of the valuation 
procedures in validating the prices of portfolio securities by allowing him to determine which 
dealer price confirmations to use and which to ignore, without obtaining documentation to support 
his adjustments; and (iv) the Valuation Committee and Fund Accounting did not ensure that the 
fair value prices assigned to many of the portfolio securities were periodically re-evaluated, 
allowing them to be carried at stale values for months at a time.   
        
       17.      Morgan Asset adopted its own procedures to determine the actual fair value to 
assign to portfolio securities and to validate those values periodically.   Among other things, 
those  procedures provided that  [q]uarterly reports listing all securities held by the Funds that 
were fair valued during the quarter under review, along with explanatory notes for the fair values 
assigned to the securities, shall be presented to the Board for its review.   Morgan Asset failed to 
fully implement this provision of its pricing policy. 
 
              18. At various times between January 2007 and July 2007, Kelsoe had his assistant 
send price adjustments to Fund Accounting.  The adjustments were communications by    Kelsoe 
to Fund Accounting concerning the values of specific portfolio securities.  In many instances, these 
adjustments were arbitrary and did not reflect fair value.  The price adjustments were routinely 
entered upon receipt by the staff accountant into a spreadsheet used to calculate the NAVs of the 
Funds.    
        
       19.    Fund Accounting did not generally request, and Kelsoe  did not generally supply, 
supporting documentation for his price adjustments.  Fund Accounting and the Funds did not 
record which securities had been assigned values by Kelsoe.     
 
       20.    As part of the Funds valuation procedures, Fund Accounting sometimes requested 
third party broker-dealer price confirmations as a means to validate the values it had assigned to 
the Funds fair valued securities.  The Funds Independent Auditor used similar requests for third 
party broker-dealer price confirmations as part of its annual year-end audits of the Funds. Fund 
Accounting or the Independent Auditor would periodically send such requests to broker-dealers 
asking them to provide price confirmations for various portfolio securities.   
 
       21.    During the period from January through July 2007, when month-end dealer    price 
confirmations were received by Fund Accounting, an employee of Fund Accounting performed a  
review to estimate whether they contained any securities prices that varied from current portfolio 
values by more than five percent.  If so, then Kelsoe determined whether the current values should 
be maintained or a new valuewhich may or may not have been     the price given by the broker-
dealershould be assigned to the security.   Thus, Fund Accounting generally allow ed Kelsoe to 

                                               6 
                                                 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

determine whether broker-dealer price confirmations were used or ignored.  In some instances, 
when price confirmations were received that were substantially lower than current portfolio values, 
Fund Accounting personnel, acting at the direction of Kelsoe, lowered values of bonds over a 
period of days, in a series of pre-planned reductions to values at or closer to, but still above, the 
price confirmations. As a result, during the interim days, Fund Accounting did not price those 
bonds at their current fair value.      
 
       22.    During the period from January through July 2007, Fund Accounting failed to 
record which bond values were not adjusted in response to dealer price confirmations at Kelsoes 
direction.   
 
       23.    The head of Fund Accounting reported to Weller, and Weller was a member of the 
Valuation Committee. He knew, or was reckless in not knowing, of the deficiencies in the 
implementation of the valuation procedures set forth above, and failed to remedy them or 
otherwise make sure fair-valued securities were accurately priced and the Funds NAVs were 
accurately calculated. During the period from January through July 2007, Weller was aware that: 
(i) the Valuation Committee did not adequately supervise Fund Accountings application of the 
valuation factors;  (ii) Kelsoe was supplying fair value price adjustments for specific securities to 
Fund Accounting but the members of the Valuation Committee did not   generally know which 
securities Kelsoe supplied fair values for or what those fair values were, and did not generally 
receive supporting documentation for those values; and (iii) the only other pricing test regularly 
applied by the Valuation Committee  was a look back  test, which compared the sales price of 
any security sold by a Fund to the valuation of that security used in the NAV calculation for the 
five business days preceding the sale.  The test only covered securities after they were sold; thus, at 
any given time, the Valuation Committee never knew how many securities prices could ultimately 
be validated by it.  Weller  nevertheless signed the Funds annual and semi-annual financial reports 
on Forms N-CSR, filed with the Commission, including certifications pursuant to Sections 302 and 
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.   
 
       24.    During the period from January 2007 through July 2007, Morgan Keegan, acting 
through Weller and Fund Accounting, failed to employ reasonable procedures to price the Funds 
portfolio securities and, as a result of that failure, did not calculate current NAVs for the Funds.  
Despite these failures, Morgan Keegan published daily NAVs of the Funds which it could not 
know were accurate and, as distributor of the open-end portfolios, sold and redeemed shares to 
investors based on those NAVs.   
        
       25.    On various dates from January 2007 through  July 2007, Morgan Asset, through 
Kelsoe, screened and influenced the price confirmations obtained from at least one broker-dealer 
(the Submitting Firm).  Among other things, the Submitting Firm was induced to provide interim 
price confirmations that were lower than the values at which the Funds were valuing certain bonds, 
but higher than the initial confirmations that the Submitting Firm had intended to provide.  The 
interim price confirmations enabled the Funds to avoid marking down the value of securities to 
reflect current fair value.  Kelsoe was aware that use of the interim price confirmations was 
inconsistent with the valuation procedures and did not reflect fair value, that the Submitting Firm 

                                               7 
                                                 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

would be providing lower price confirmations in response to future pricing validation requests, and 
that the Funds would be required to further mark down the value of the securities to reflect their 
already diminished value, but that information was not disclosed to Fund Accounting, the Funds 
Boards of Directors or the Independent Auditor.  In some instances, even after causing the 
Submitting Firm to increase its price confirmations, Kelsoe subsequently provided price 
adjustments to Fund Accounting that were higher than even the Submitting Firms increased price 
confirmations.  These adjustments were not consistent with the Funds procedures.  In other 
instances, the Submitting Firm was induced to not provide price confirmations to Fund Accounting 
(or, depending on the period, to the Independent Auditor), where those price confirmations would 
have been significantly lower than the Funds current valuations of the relevant bonds.  Fund 
Accounting and  the Funds Boards were not advised that the Submitting Firm had proposed price 
confirmations which were lower than the current valuations recorded by the Funds, and that the 
Submitting Firm had refrained from submitting price confirmations to Fund Accounting or had 
submitted price confirmations at higher prices than it had originally planned.   
 
       26.        I  n each of the Funds annual and semi -annual reports filed with the Commission on 
Forms N-CSR during the relevant period (including, among others, the Annual Report for the 
Morgan Keegan Select Fund, Inc. for the year -ended June 30, 2007 filed with the Commission on 
October 4, 2007), Kelsoe included a signed letter to investors reporting on the Funds performance 
based on net asset value.  In fact, the performance reported was materially misstated.  Untrue 
statements of material fact concerning the Funds performance were made in the Funds annual 
and semi-annual reports filed with the Commission on Forms N-CSR.  Morgan Asset, through 
Kelsoe, also provided a quarterly valuation packet reflecting inflated prices for certain securities to 
the Funds Boards, failed to disclose to the Funds Boards information indicating that the Funds 
NAVs were inflated and that broker-dealer price confirmations were being screened and caused to 
be altered, and provided Fund Accounting with unsubstantiated price adjustments.  In addition, the 
prospectuses incorrectly described Morgan Asset as responsible for fair valuation of the Funds 
portfolios. 
D.     VIOLATIONS 
 
       27.    Investment advisers owe their clients, including investment company clients, a 
fiduciary duty. Transamerica Mortgage Advisers, Inc. v. Lewis                                 , 444 U.S.11, 17 (1979); SEC v. 
Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc. 375 U.S. 180, 195-97 (1963). Misstatements or omissions of 
fact by an investment adviser, such as those made to the Funds boards, violate an advisers 
fiduciary duty and constitute fraud when they are material. Similarly, the failure to disclose to the 
Funds boards that Morgan Asset and Morgan Keegan were not complying with stated valuation 
procedures constitutes fraud.  In addition, the knowing or reckless failure to value securities, for 
which market quotations are not readily available, consistent with fair value requirements under the 
Investment Company Act and that materially affects a funds NAV constitutes fraud. See, In re 
Piper Capital Management, Inc., Exch. Act. Rel.48409 (August 26, 2003). Section 206(1) of the 
Advisers Act makes it unlawful for an investment adviser to employ any device, scheme or artifice 
to defraud any client or prospective client.  Section 206(2) makes it unlawful for an investment 
adviser to engage in any transaction, practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or 
deceit upon any client or prospective client.   As a result of the conduct described above, 
                                               8

Respondent Morgan Asset willfully violated, and Kelsoe willfully aided and abetted and caused 
violations of, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act. 
               
              28. Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act prohibits fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative 
practices or courses of business by an investment adviser.  Rule 206(4)-7 requires investment 
advisers to [a]dopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent 
violation of the Advisers Act and the rules thereunder by their supervised persons.  An advisers 
failure to have adequate compliance policies and procedures in place will constitute a violation of 
our rules independent of any other securities law violation.  Compliance Programs of Investment 
Companies and Investment Advisers, Advisers Act Release No. 2204, 68 F.R. 74714, 74715 (Dec. 
24, 2003) (Compliance Programs Release).  As a result of the conduct described above, 
Respondent Morgan Asset willfully violated, and Respondent Kelsoe willfully aided and abetted 
and caused violations of, Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder. 
       29.        Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act prohibits untrue statements of 
material fact or omissions to state facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in the 
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in any registration 
statement, report or other document filed pursuant to the Investment Company Act or the 
keeping of which is required pursuant to Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act.  Any 
person who makes a material misrepresentation concerning a Funds performance in the Funds 
annual and semi-annual reports filed with the Commission, or in the records required to be 
maintained by the Fund, or submits inflated prices to be included in the Funds NAV calculations 
and the records forming the basis for the Funds financial statements, violates Section 34(b). As 
a result of the conduct described above, Respondents Morgan Asset  and Kelsoe willfully 
violated, and Respondent Morgan Keegan willfully aided, abetted, and caused violations of, 
Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act. 
        
       30.        R  ule 22c-1 under the Investment Company Act prohibits the sale or redemption of 
shares in a registered investment company except at a price based on the current net asset value of 
such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of 
an order to purchase or sell such security.  For an NAV to be deemed current, Section 2(a)(41) of 
the Investment Company Act and Rule 2a  -4 thereunder require portfolio securities for which 
market quotations are not readily available to be valued at fair value. As a result of the conduct 
described above, Respondent Morgan Keegan willfully violated,  4
                                                                  and Respondents Morgan Asset , 
Kelsoe and Weller willfully aided and abetted and caused violations of, Rule 22c-1 promulgated 
under the Investment Company Act.  
        
       31.    Rule 38a-1 under the Investment Company Act requires that a registered 
investment company adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to 
prevent violation of the federal securities laws by the fund and to provide for oversight of 
compliance by the funds investment adviser.  Failure of a fund to have adequate compliance

  A willful violation of the securities laws means merely that the person charged with the duty 
knows what he is doing. Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting

policies and procedures in place and/or to implement them will constitute a violation of Rule 38a-1 
independent of any other securities law violations. Compliance Programs Release. Morgan 
Keegan and Morgan Asset knowingly and substantially assisted the Funds failure to implement 
fair valuation procedures, which resulted in prices that did not reflect current NAVs.   Morgan 
Keegan, Morgan Asset, Kelsoe and Weller thereby willfully aided and abetted and caused the 
Funds violations of Rule 38a-1.

       32.    Respondent Morgan Keegan undertakes as follows: 
 
       A.          Morgan Keegan shall not, for a period of three years from the date of the Order, be 
involved in, or responsible for, recommending to, or determining on behalf of, a registered 
investment companys board of directors or trustees or such companys valuation committee, the 
value of any portfolio security for which market quotations are not readily available.  
  
       B.     If, after three years but within six years from the date of the Order, Morgan Keegan 
becomes involved in, or responsible for, determining or recommending determinations to a 
registered investment companys board of directors or trustees or valuation committee of the value 
of any portfolio security for which market quotations are not readily available and which are held 
by or on behalf of such registered investment company, Morgan Keegan shall promptly notify 
Commission counsel identified below or his successor and within 30 days of beginning such 
valuation activity, shall hire, at its expense, an Independent Consultant (Consultant) not 
unacceptable to the Commissions staff, to review the valuations provided by Morgan Keegan  to 
any registered investment company for the next two quarters following the beginning of such 
valuation activity, and make an Initial Report with recommendations thereafter on Morgan 
Keegans policies, procedures and practices with regard to such valuations.  The Initial Report 
shall describe the review performed and the conclusions reached, and will include any 
recommendations deemed necessary to make the policies, procedures, and practices adequate and 
consistent with GAAP and the Investment Company Act. Morgan Keegan shall cooperate fully 
with the Consultant and shall provide the Consultant with access to its files, books, records, and 
personnel as reasonably requested for the review.  Morgan Keegan shall cause the review to begin 
no later than 60 days after beginning such valuation activity.

writing respond to the Initial Report.  In such response, Morgan Keegan shall advise the Consultant 
and the Commissions staff of the recommendations from the Initial Report that it has determined 
to accept and the recommendations that it considers to be unduly burdensome. With respect to any 

                                               10

recommendation that Morgan Keegan deems unduly burdensome, Morgan Keegan may propose an 
alternative policy, procedure or system designed to achieve the same objective or purpose.   
                
            E.           Morgan Keegan shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement with the 
Consultant within 60 days of the date of the receipt of the Initial Report with respect to any 
recommendation that Morgan Keegan deems unduly burdensome.  If the Consultant and Morgan 
Keegan are unable to agree on an alternative proposal, Morgan Keegan shall abide by the 
recommendation of the Consultant. 
 
             F.          Within 90 days of the date of the receipt of the Initial Report, Morgan Keegan

Report, and shall state whether Morgan Keegan has fully complied with the recommendations in 
the Initial Report.  
 
           H.           Morgan Keegan shall cause the Consultant to complete the aforementioned 
review and submit a written Final Report to Morgan Keegan and to the Commissions staff 
within 400 days of the date of the Initial Report.  The Final Report shall recite the efforts the 
Consultant undertook to review Morgan Keegans policies, procedures, and practices; set forth 
the Consultants conclusions and recommendations; and describe how Morgan Keegan is 
implementing those recommendations. 

       I.      Morgan Keegan shall take all necessary and appropriate steps to adopt and

       J.      Respondent Weller is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the

                                               17 
                                                  
---------------------Page 18---------------------

               1.     a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or review, 
of any public companys financial statements that are filed with the Commission.  Such an 
application must satisfy the Commission that Respondent Wellers work in his practice before the 
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company for 
which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the 
Commission in this capacity; and/or 
      
               2.     an independent accountant.  Such an application must satisfy the 
Commission that: 
      
                            (a) Respondent Weller, or the public accounting firm with which he is 
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Board) in 
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective; 
 
                             (b) Respondent Weller, or the registered public accounting firm with 
which he is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any 
criticisms of or potential defects in the Respondents or the firms quality control system that 
would indicate that the Respondent will not receive appropriate supervision; 

                             (c) Respondent Weller has resolved all disciplinary issues with the 
Board, and has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board 
(other than reinstatement by the Commission); and 
 
                             (d) Respondent Weller acknowledges his responsibility, as long as 
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply 
with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all 
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control 
standards.   
      
       The Commission will consider an application by Respondent Weller to resume appearing 
or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has 
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.  However, if 
state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will consider an 
application on its other merits.  The Commissions review may include consideration of, in 
addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Respondents character, 
integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission. 
        
       K.      Respondents Morgan Keegan and Morgan Asset shall jointly and severally pay 
disgorgement of $20,500,000 and prejudgment interest of $4,500,000   to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, and a civil penalty of $75,000,000 to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, within ten (10) business days of the entry of this Order.  
 
       L.      Respondent Kelsoe shall pay a civil penalty of $250,000 to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, within ten (10) days of this Order. 
        
                                                18 
                                                  
---------------------Page 19---------------------

       M.     Respondent Weller shall pay a civil penalty of $50,000 to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, within ten (10) days of this Order.  
        
       N.      All payments pursuant to paragraphs IV. K, L and M, above, shall be made by 
certified check, bank cashier's check, or United States postal money order payable to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission.  The payment shall be delivered or mailed to the Office of 
Financial Management, Accounts Receivable, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F 
Street, NE, Stop 6042, Washington DC 20549, and shall be accompanied by a letter identifying 
Respondent as a respondent in these proceedi ngs; setting forth the file number of these 
proceedings; and specifying that payment is made pursuant to this Order, a copy of which cover 
letter and money order or check shall be sent to William P. Hicks, Associate Regional 
Administrator, Securities and Exchange Commission, 3475 Lenox Rd., N.E., Suite 500, Atlanta, 
GA 30326-1232.  If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 
U.S.C. § 3717 and/or SEC Rule of Practice 600.     
 
       Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, a Fair Fund is 
created for the disgorgement, interest, and penalties described in Paragraphs IV. K, L and M and 
any funds paid in connection with related actions pursuant to Paragraph III. 36, above.  Regardless 
of whether any such distribution is made from such Fair Fund, amounts ordered to be paid as civil 
money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all 
purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, 
Respondents agree that in any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled 
to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the 
amount of any part of Respondents payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset").  If 
the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that any 
Respondent receiving such offset shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the 
Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty 
Offset to the United States Treasury or to a Fair Fund, as the Commission directs.  Such a payment 
shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of 
the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding.  For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor 
Action" means a private damages action brought against any of the Respondents by or on behalf of 
one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the 
Commission in this proceeding. 
 
       O.          The disgorgement, interest, civil penalties, and any other funds which may be 
paid to the Fair Fund through or as the result of related actions, shall be aggregated in the Fair 
Fund, which shall be maintained in an interest-bearing account, and shall be distributed pursuant 
to a distribution plan (the "Plan") to be administered in accordance with the Commission Rules 
on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.  A Fund Administrator (the Administrator) shall be 
appointed by the Commission.  The Administrator shall identify the investors in the Funds who 
suffered losses as a result of the violations determined herein, evaluate investor claims and 
propose and effectuate a plan to distribute the Fair Fund resulting from this order. The Fair Fund 
shall be used to compensate injured customers for their loss.  Under no circumstances shall any 
part of the Fair Fund be returned to Morgan Keegan, Morgan Asset, Kelsoe or Weller.

Respondent Morgan Keegan shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of such distribution 
within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice for such services.

above. 
 
              Q.  Morgan Asset shall comply with the undertakings specified in Paragraph 34 above.
