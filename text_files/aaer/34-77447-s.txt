SEC Announces Charges Against Florida-based Audit Firm and its Owner Accused of 
Violating Auditor Independence Rules and Committing Audit Failures  (3-17180) 
 
The Securities and  Exchange Commission today  announced charges against Florida-based audit 
firm Berman & Company, P.A., and    its sole owner Elliot R. Berman, CPA, alleging violations 
of auditor independence  rules and multiple audit failures relating to Berman & Co.s 2010 
and 2011 year-end audits of MusclePharm Corporation . 
 
The SECs Enforcement Division and Office of the Chief Accountant allege that, during  
Berman & Co.s 2010 and 2011 year end audits of MusclePharm   , Berman & Co. and Berman: 
   •  Audited MusclePharms    financial statements and issued audit reports while Berman & 
       Co. was not independent because of indemnification provisions in Berman & Co.s 
       engagement letters; and 
   •  Failed to recognize that MusclePharm  improperly accounted for sales incentives, 
       advertising, and promotions, and inappropriately relied on management representations 
       as sufficient audit evidence.   
 
The SECs Enforcement Division and Office of the Chief Accountant further allege that 
during Berman & Co.s 2011 year-end audit of MusclePharm, Berman & Co. and Berman: 
   •  Ignored audit evidence demonstrating that MusclePharm  s largest customer in 2011 was 
       a related party requiring disclosure and inappropriately relied on management 
       representations; and 
   •  Failed to recognize that MusclePharm  did not disclose its sponsorship commitments and 
       international sales as required. 
 
The matter will be scheduled for a public hearing before an administrative law judge, who 
will prepare an initial decision stating what, if any, remedial actions are appropriate.  
 
The SECs investigation was conducted by Kimberly L. Frederick, Michael F. DAngelo, and 
Mary S. Brady.  The case is being supervised by Thomas J. Krysa and litigation assistance is 
being provided by Mark L. Williams and Gregory Kasper.
