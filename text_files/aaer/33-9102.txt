                                            I. 
                                              
       The Commission's public official files disclose that: 
 
       On or about March 27, 2009, Tsukuda-America Inc. (“Tsukuda”) filed a Form S-1 
registration statement with the Commission, and on or about April 10, 2009, it filed an 
amended statement on Form S-1\A.  The registration statement was declared effective on 
April 14, 2009.   The registration statement  included an audit report on the financial 
statements of Tsukuda purportedly made by Weinberg & Company, P.A. (“Weinberg”), 
an accounting firm in Boca Raton, Florida, and a consent purportedly made on behalf of 
Weinberg to the inclusion of the audit report in the registration statement. 
  
                                            II. 
                                              
       The Division of Enforcement alleges, as set forth in the Statement of Matters of 
the Division of Enforcement attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, that 
the Tsukuda registration statement, as originally filed and as amended, included untrue 
statements of material fact and omitted material facts required to be stated therein or 
necessary to make the statements made not misleading, including but not limited to, the 
false representation that Weinberg audited, and prepared an audit report upon, the 
financial statements of Tsukuda, and that Weinberg consented to the inclusion of the 
audit report in Tsukuda’s registration statement, and the omission to disclose that the 
audit report and consent were not legitimate, in violation of the requirements of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and the Commission’s forms and regulations 
governing the offer and sale of securities to the public.

                                           III. 
 
       The Commission, having considered the aforesaid information, deems it 
appropriate and in the public interest that public proceedings pursuant to Section 8(d) of 
the Securities Act be, and they hereby are, instituted with respect to the registration 
statement to determine whether the allegations of the Division of Enforcement, as set 
forth in the Statement of Matters attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, 
are true; to afford registrant with an opportunity to establish any defenses to these 
allegations; and to determine whether a stop order should issue suspending the 
effectiveness of the Tsukuda registration statement referred to herein.  Accordingly, 
  
       IT IS ORDERED that public proceedings be and hereby are instituted under 
Securities Act Section 8(d), such hearing to be commenced at 10:00 a.m. on February 9, 
2010, at the Commission’s offices at 801 Brickell Ave., Suite 1800, Miami, FL 33131, and 
to continue thereafter at such time and place as the hearing officer may determine. 
 
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, in the interest of justice and without prejudice to any 
party, that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations contained in this Order within  
ten (10) days after service of this Order, as  provided by Rule 220 of the Commission's Rules 
of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220 and Rule 100(c) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 
C.F.R. § 201.100(c). 
        
       If Respondent fails to file  the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after  
being duly notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be  
determined against him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be  
deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's 
Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310. 
        
       This Order shall be served  forthwith upon Respondent  personally or by certified  
mail. 
 
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, in the interest of justice and without prejudice to any 
party, that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial decision no later than 60 days 
from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 100(c) of the Commission’s Rules of  
Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.100(c).

        In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission 
engaged in the performance of investigative or  prosecuting functions in  this or any factually 
related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the de cision of this matter, 
except as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice.  Since this proceeding is  
not “rule making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it 
is not deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any               
final Commission action.
