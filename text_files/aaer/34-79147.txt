A.     SETTLING RESPONDENTS              
  
       1.      David S. Hall, P.C. d/b/a/ The Hall Group CPAs is a Texas corporation 
which was licensed to practice public accountancy in Texas as The Hall Group CPAs from 
April 5, 2006 through May 31, 2014.  Thakkar CPA, PLLC (Thakkar CPA)         4
                                                                                 acquired 
certain assets of David S. Hall, P.C. on or about January 6, 2014 (the Closing Date), after 

                                                                                                                                                 
               Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of 
               appearing or practicing before it . . . to any person who is found . . . to have 
               engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct. 
 
Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) provides, in pertinent part, that: 
 
               The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of 
               appearing or practicing before it . . . to any person who is foundto have 
               willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any  provision of 
               the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 
3
 The findings herein are made pursuant to the Hall Respondents Offer of Settlement and are not 
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.   
4
 On April 6, 2016, the Commission issued an Order finding that Thakkar CPA, its managing 
partner, and its owner, engaged in improper professional conduct and violated or willfully 
violated Rule 2-02 of Regulation S-X and caused issuers to violate Section 13 (a) of the Exchange 
Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  The Order also found that Thakkar CPAs Vice 
President of Operations caused Thakkar CPAs violations of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X 
and  caused issuers to violate Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 
thereunder.  In the Matter of Thakkar CPA, PLLC et. al, Exchange Act Rel. No. 77542 (April 6, 
2016). 

                                              2 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

which the latter firm ceased operations.  Thakkar CPA agreed to pay David S. Hall, P.C. 
$450,000 in cash at closing and to enter into a 5%, two-year promissory note for $313,516.  
On March 25, 2015, David S. Hall, P.C. requested that its registration with the PCAOB be 
withdrawn.  In their June 16, 2016 answer to the order instituting these proceedings, the 
Hall Group and David Hall admitted the findings in paragraphs 7, 9, 12-14, 18, 20-21, and 
28 below.  And in his September 2, 2016                  Order on Motions for Summary Disposition in 
these proceedings, the administrative law judge found in favor of the Division of 
Enforcement as against the Hall Group and David Hall, at least as to the period 
commencing July 2013, on the matters set forth in paragraphs 6, 15-16, 19, 22, 27, 29-30, 
33-35, and 38 below. 
        
       2.     David S. Hall, age 58 and a resident of   Lewisville, Texas, is a CPA 
licensed in Texas.  Hall owns 100% of David S. Hall, P.C.  On April 15, 2014, Hall 
became the CFO for DynaResource, Inc.,  (DynaResource) whose auditor was David S. 
Hall, P.C. d/b/a The Hall Group CPAs through January 29, 2014 and, later, Thakkar CPA 
d/b/a The Hall Group CPAs for the 2013 audit and 2014 reviews.  In their June 16, 2016 
answer to the order instituting these proceedings, the Hall Group and David Hall admitted 
the findings in paragraphs 7, 9, 12-14, 18, 20-21, and 28 below.  And in his September 2, 
2016 Order on Motions for Summary Disposition in these proceedings, the administrative 
law judge found in favor of the Division of Enforcement as against the Hall Group and 
David Hall, at least as to the period commencing July 2013, on the matters set forth in 
paragraphs 6, 15-16, 19, 22, 27, 29-30, 33-35, and 38 below. 
        
B.     OTHER RESPONDENTS           
        
       3.     Michelle L. Helterbran Cochran (Helterbran), age 47 and a resident of 
Coppell, Texas, is a CPA licensed in the state of Texas.  From September 2007 through 
July 2013, Helterbran was employed by David S. Hall, P.C. and became a non-equity 
partner with that firm in February 2012.   
        
       4.     Susan A. Cisneros (Cisneros), age 58 and a resident of Flower Mound, 
Texas, holds a Masters of Science degree in Accounting from the University of North 
Texas but is not a CPA.  Cisneros worked as an audit senior for David S. Hall, P.C. from 
January 2005 through January 2012 and again from May 2013 through December 2013.                           
 
C.     OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES 
 
       5.     Thakkar CPA, is a Texas corporation formed to acquire certain assets of 
David S. Hall, P.C. and provided auditing services for multiple public companies between 
January 2014 and January 2015 signing audit reports as The Hall Group CPAs, but never 
became registered with the PCAOB.

D.     FACTS 
        
      i.    Failure to Conduct Audits and Reviews in Accordance with PCAOB 
           Standards 
            
       6.     The Hall Group, Hall, Helterbran, and Cisneros collectively failed to 
conduct at least 16 annual audits and 35 quarterly reviews5
                                                          in accordance with PCAOB 
standards in at least three ways: (1) they repeatedly failed to prepare adequate audit 
documentation in connection with audit and review engagements; (2) failed to conduct  or 
failed to obtain  an engagement quality review (EQR) of audit and review engagements 
by a qualified reviewer; and (3) on at least four engagements, The Hall Group and Hall 
performed audit services while the firms independence was impaired.  As a result, The 
Hall Group falsely stated that it conducted its audits in accordance with PCAOB standards 
in at least 16 annual audit reports for eight issuers.  Additionally, Hall, after becoming CFO 
of DynaResource, Inc., allowed Thakkar CPA to provide audit services to DynaResource, 
Inc. even though he knew he had a direct financial interest in and a business relationship 
with the companys external audit firm. 
        
              a.  Failure to Adequately Prepare Required Audit Documentation 
                   
       7.     PCAOB Auditing     Standard No. 3, Audit Documentation (AS 3), states 
that [a]udit documentation is the written record of the basis for the auditors conclusions 
that provides the support for the auditors representations, whether those representations are 
contained in the auditors report or otherwise.  (emphasis in original.)  AS 3, ¶  2.  
Additionally, AS 3 states that: 
        
       The auditor must document the procedures performed, evidence obtained, 
       and conclusions reached with respect to relevant financial statement 
       assertions.  Audit documentation must clearly d emonstrate that the work 
       was in fact   performed.   This documentation requirement applies to the 
       work of all those who participate in the engagement as well as to the work 
       of specialists the auditor uses as evidential ma  tter in evaluating relevant 
       financial statement assertions.     Audit documentation must contain 
       sufficient information to enable an experienced auditor, having no 
       previous connection with the engagement: 
           a.  To understand the nature, timing, extent, and results of the 
              procedures performed, evidence obtained, and conclusions 
              reached, and  
           b.  To determine who performed the work and the date such work was 
              completed as well as the person who reviewed the work and the 
              date of such review. (emphasis added) AS 3, ¶  6 

       8.     AS 3 states that an auditor must identify all significant findings or issues in 
an engagement completion document, which includes either all information necessary to 
                                                 
5
 See Appendix attached herewith. 

                                            4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

understand the significant findings, issues or provides references to other audit 
documentation.  AS 3, ¶ 13 (emphasis in original.) 
        
       9.     The Hall Group utilized standardized forms and checklists while 
documenting its audit work.  For example, The Hall Group used a Supervision, Review 
and Approval Form to document, in part, (1) who performed the partner review and the 
engagement quality review, (2) the dates of such reviews, (3) the partners approval for 
issuance of the report, and (4) the engagement quality reviewers concurring approval for 
issuance of the report.  The Hall Group also used a standardized Engagement Completion 
Document Form to assist in summarizing all significant findings or issues.   
        
       10.    Hall and Helterbran failed to comply with AS 3 on multiple audits because 
their workpapers contained blank or incomplete Supervision, Review, and Approval Forms 
and blank or incomplete Engagement Completion Document Forms for at least five audit 
and twenty review engagements over multiple periods.   
        
       11.    The existence of blank or incomplete Engagement Completion Document 
Forms further evidences Halls and Helterbrans failure to prepare documentation in 
accordance with AS 3 requirements and does not allow an experienced auditor, having no 
previous connection with the engagement, to determine who reviewed the work and the 
date of such review.   
 
              b.  Failure to Obtain Required Engagement Quality Reviews 
                   
       12.    Auditing Standard No. 7, Engagement Quality Review (AS 7), requires an 
auditor to obtain an EQR and concurring approval to issue the engagement report for each 
audit and interim review engagement.6
                                       Additionally, AS 7 states, [a]n engagement quality 
reviewer from the firm that issues the engagement report (or communicates an engagement 
conclusion, if no report is issued) must be a partner or another individual in an equivalent 
position.  Among other things, a n engagement quality reviewer must be competent, i.e., 
must possess the level of knowledge and competence related to accounting, auditing and 
financial reporting required to serve as the engagement partner on the engagement under 
review.  Additionally, an engagement quality reviewer must have competence, 
independence, integrity, and objectivity.  To maintain objectivity, the engagement quality 
reviewer should not make decisions on behalf of the engagement team or assume any of the 
responsibilities of the engagement team.  AS 7, ¶¶ 3-7. An audit firm may grant permission 
to the client to use the firms audit report only after the engagement quality reviewer 
provides concurring approval of issuance, AS 7, ¶ 13. 
        
       13.    The PCAOB defines the engagement partner as the member of the 
engagement team with primary responsibility for the audit.  Auditing Standard No. 10, 
Supervision of the Audit Engagement, (AS 10), Appendix, A2.  The engagement partner 
remains responsible for the engagement and its performance, notwithstanding the 
                                                 
6
 AS 7 is effective for audits and interim reviews for fiscal years beginning on or after 
December 15, 2009.  
 

                                           5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

involvement of the engagement quality reviewer.  AS 7, ¶7.  Accordingly, the engagement 
partner is responsible for, among other things, compliance with PCAOB standards.  AS 10, 
¶3. 
        
       14.    Audit firms quality control policies and procedures should include 
provisions that provide the firm with reasonable assurance that the engagement quality 
reviewer has sufficient competence, among other things, to perform the EQR in accordance 
with PCAOB standards.  AS 7, ¶4.  Policies and procedures should be established to 
provide the firm with reasonable assurance that those hired possess the appropriate 
characteristics to enable them to perform competently and [w]ork is assigned to 
personnel having the degree of technical training and proficiency required in the 
circumstances.  PCAOB Quality Control Standard QC Section 40, The Personnel 
Management Element of a Firm's System of Quality Control-Competencies Required by a 
Practitioner-in-Charge of an Attest Engagement, ¶ 02. 
        
       15.    Hall and The Hall Group failed to establish these required policies and 
procedures.  Moreover, on multiple occasions, Hall and Helterbran also failed to comply 
with AS 7 by either failing to obtain any EQR or instructing an unqualified person, 
including Cisneros, to perform engagement quality reviews for multiple audit and review 
engagements from 2010 through 2013.  For at least two audit engagements, Hall 
improperly acted as both the engagement partner and the EQR partner. 
        
       16.    Hall and Helterbran knowingly or at least recklessly directed or permitted 
Cisneros to perform an EQR on multiple audits and reviews despite knowing she was not a 
partner or someone in an equivalent position.7
                                              Cisneros knowingly or at least recklessly 
provided the engagement quality reviewers concurring approval of issuance of the report 
despite knowing that she was not a partner or someone in an equivalent position at The 
Hall Group and not qualified to conduct an EQR.  Indeed, Cisneros acknowledged to 
Commission staff that she lacked the knowledge and competence in accounting, auditing, 
and financial reporting required to serve as engagement partner for an engagement 
conducted under PCAOB standards. 
        
       17.    Cisneros performed the engagement quality reviews for at least eight issuer 
audit engagements for seven issuers and 15 reviews of six issuers interim financial 
information, and signed Supervision, Review, and Approval Forms, as the engagement 
quality reviewer.  In each instance, Hall and Helterbran failed to determine whether 
Cisneros prepared required documentation in connection with the EQRs she performed.  
AS 7, ¶¶ 9-11 and ¶ 21.   
        
       18.    Hall failed to comply with AS 7 even after confirming to the PCAOB that 
he would do so.  In connection the PCAOBs 2013 inspection of The Hall Group, Hall 
                                                 
7
 Although AS 7 does not necessarily require that persons performing EQRs be licensed CPAs, 
the standard states that the person must be a partner or another individual in an equivalent 
position.  Cisneros not being a CPA is relevant here because The Hall Group required anyone 
holding the title of Principal/Partner must also be a licensed CPA in Texas.  
 

                                            6 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

confirmed in writing to the PCAOB inspection team that Cisneros performed the EQR for 
two issuers fiscal year 2012 audits and the EQRs for the first, second, and third quarter 
reviews for a third issuer.8
                           Hall also told the inspection team during its fieldwork that 
Cisneros was not a CPA.  In August 2013, the PCAOB issued an inspection comment 
stating that The Hall Group failed to comply with AS 7 and failed to ensure that EQRs 
were performed by persons with sufficient qualifications.  The inspection comment states 
that Halls representations demonstrated that Cisneros did not meet the firms requirements 
for a Principal/Partner, and, accordingly, she did not meet the AS 7 requirements for 
serving as EQR.  In an August 5, 2013 handwritten response to this inspection comment 
form, Hall wrote, [w]e agree with the issue noted above and are in the process for [sic] 
negotiating with an outside firm (PCAOB registered) and will not issue any more reports 
until this is in place and have that firm perform the appropriate review process. (emphasis 
added). 
        
       19.     Contrary to Halls representation, he knowingly disregarded the PCAOB 
standards when he failed to obtain an EQR by a qualified reviewer for any                                                                      of the firms 
review and audit engagements for fiscal periods ended June 30 and September 30, 2013  
engagements conducted after his written representation to the PCAOB.  On at least one 
2013 audit, Hall added a memo to the audit file stating, in part, The Hall Group did not 
have access to an Engagement Quality Reviewer for this audit and [t]herefore, Mr. Hall 
acted as Eng. Quality Reviewer.  Hall then signed the supervision, review, and approval 
checklist as both the engagement and EQR partner.  Subsequently, for the first quarter 
fiscal year 2014 review for this same client, Hall did not sign off as EQR but added a 
memo to the file reiterating that The Hall Group did not have access to an Engagement 
Quality Reviewer and concluded by stating [w]e stand by our work. 
                   
               c.  The Hall Groups Independence Was Impaired 
                   
       20.     Section 10A(j) of the Exchange Act, Audit Partner Rotation                                   , states it shall 
be unlawful for a registered public accounting firm to provide audit services to an issuer if 
the lead (or coordinating) audit partner (having primary responsibility for the audit) or the 
partner responsible for reviewing the audit, has performed audit services for that issuer in 
each of the previous five fiscal years of that issuer.   The Commissions independence rules 
allow engagement and concurring partners to serve for five consecutive years, after which 
they may not serve in either role for another period of five years.  Rule 2-01(c)(6)(i)(A) of 
Regulation S-X.   Related PCAOB rules and standards require that a registered public 
accounting firm and its associated persons be independent of the Firms issuer audit clients.   
                   
       21.     Hall was The Hall Gro ups sole partner prior to 2012 and therefore served 
as the only engagement partner on each of The Hall Groups engagements before 2012.  In 
a February 2012 response to the PCAOB addressing deficiencies noted in the PCAOBs 
2010 inspection, Hall acknowledged that he served as the lead engagement partner for one 
issuer for five consecutive years and the firms review of the issuers first quarter of the

 Freestone Resources, Inc. for fiscal year ended June 30, 2012; Seven Arts Entertainment for 
fiscal year ended June 30, 2012; and DynaResource for quarters ended March 31, June 30, and 
Sept. 30, 2012. 

                                            7

sixth year.  Hall explained that it was the last quarter the firm was engaged as the issuers 
auditor, and that to remediate, he (1) named Helterbran as a partner in February 2012; and 
(2) developed a log to ensure that appropriate partner rotation occurs.  
        
       22.    After Helterbrans departure in early July 2013, Hall was once again The 
Hall Groups sole partner.  Hall attempted to address the partner rotation issue by offering 
to promote one of his audit staff to a non-equity partner but the individual rejected the 
offer.  As a result, Hall knowingly or at least recklessly served as the lead engagement 
partner for at least three of The Hall Groups reviews for quarters ended June 30, 2013 and 
September 30, 2013, even though he  had already served as the lead engagement partner for 
five consecutive years and, accordingly, The Hall Group lacked independence under the 
Commissions rules with respect to these issuers. 
                   
              d.  Reports on Audited Financial Statements 
                   
       23.    Under AU § 508, Reports on Audited Financial Statements, an auditor may 
only express an unqualified opinion on historical financial statements when he has formed 
such an opinion on the basis of an audit performed in accordance with PCAOB standards.  
AU § 508.07. 
        
       24.    Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X requires an accountants report to state 
whether the audit was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  
And references in Commission rules and staff guidance and in the federal securities laws 
to GAAS or to specific standards under GAAS, as they relate to issuers, should be 
understood to mean the standards of the PCAOB plus any applicable rules of the 
Commission.  See SEC Release No. 34-49708 (May 14, 2004).  Thus, an auditor violates 
Regulation S-X Rule 2-02(b)(1) if it issues a report stating it has conducted its audit in 
accordance with PCAOB standards when it has not.   
        
       25.    The Hall Gr oup issued and Hall and Helterbran approved the issuance of, at 
least 16 audit reports, including at least eight for which Cisneros provided concurring 
approval of issuance.  Each of the firms audit reports states that The Hall Group CPAs 
conducted its audits in accordance with PCAOB standards.  As stated above, these 
statements were false.  As a result, The Hall Group willfully violated, and Hall, Helterbran, 
and Cisneros willfully aided and abetted The Hall Groups  violations of, Rule 2-02(b)(1).  
                   
     ii.    Hall, as CFO, Allowed DynaResource to File its 2014 Forms 10-Q Without 
           Reviews by an Independent Public Accountant 
            
       26.    Rule 10-01(d) of Regulation S-X states, in part, [p]rior to filing, interim 
financial statements included in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (17 CFR 249.308(a)) must 
be reviewed by an independent public accountant using professional standards and 
procedures for conducting such reviews.  Rules 2-01(c)(1) and 2-01(c)(3) of Regulation S-
X state, in part, that an accountant is not independent when the accounting firm has any 
loan to or from, or certain business relationships with, an audit clients officers.   
        

                                           8 
---------------------Page 9---------------------

       27.    After selling certain of his firms assets to Thakkar CPA, Hall assisted 
Thakkar CPA in soliciting audit engagements from each of The Hall Groups audit clients, 
including DynaResource.  DynaResource engaged Thakkar CPA in January 2014.  On 
April 15, 2014, Thakkar CPA issued an audit report on DynaResources 2013 financial 
statements, which it signed as The Hall Group CPAs.  The same day, DynaResource 
named Hall as its CFO.  Thereafter, Hall functioned as Thakkar CPAs primary contact on 
audit-related issues.  Thakkar CPA continued as DynaResources external auditor until it 
resigned on March 5, 2015. 
        
       28.    DynaResource filed its first, second, and third quarter 2014 Forms 10-Q 
with the Commission after the included financial statements were reviewed by Thakkar 
CPA.  Hall signed management letters of representation in connection with each of 
Thakkar CPAs reviews, and made certifications required under Rule 13a-14 of the 
Exchange Act for each of DynaResources first, second, and third quarter 2014 Forms 
10-Q. 
        
       29.    Hall allowed Thakkar CPA to provide audit services to DynaResource even 
though he knew that he was an officer of the company and that he had a direct financial 
interest in and a business relationship with Thakkar, CPA.  Specifically, the following 
events impaired Thakkar CPAs independence with respect to its reviews of interim 
financial information DynaResource included in its Forms 10-Q filed with the Commission 
in 2014:   
        
   •  Thakkar CPA delivered a note payable to David S. Hall  , P.C., which remained 
       outstanding even after Hall became DynaResources CFO, as a result of the terms 
       of the asset purchase agreement, under which Thakkar paid Hall $450,000 in cash 
       and undertook a 5%, two -year promissory note for $313,516.  The final purchase 
       price also was dependent upon the future success of Thakkar CPA as  the purchase 
       price was to be adjusted up or down based upon actual collection during the three 
       years following the Closing Date.  Additionally, the asset purchase agreement 
       included a provision under which Hall could earn fees for providing services to 
       Thakkar CPA after the Closing Date (although Hall did not earn any fees under 
       this provision). 
    
   •  Thakkar CPA unilaterally suspended payments on the promissory note to David 
       S. Hall  , P.C. in May 2014 after determining that future collections were likely to 
       be less than the amounts expected at the Closing Date.   

       30.    Hall allowed Thakkar CPA to provide audit services to DynaResource even 
though he knew he had a direct financial interest in and a business relationship with the 
companys audit firm and, despite this knowledge, executed the certifications required 
under Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act and allowed DynaResource to file its 2014 Forms 
10-Q with the Commission.

E.     VIOLATIONS 
 
       31.    As a result of the conduct described above, The Hall Group willfully 
violated, and Hall willfully aided and abetted and caused The Hall Groups violations of, 
Section 10A(j), which makes it unlawful for a registered public accounting firm to provide

       C.     The Hall Group and David S. Hall are denied the privilege of appearing or 
practicing before the Commission as accountants.   
        
       D.     David S. Hall shall, within 14 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil 
money penalty in the amount of $25,000.00 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for 
transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section

       E.     Payment must be made in one of the following ways:   
        
              (1)     Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the

in any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall 
they benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the 
amount of any part of Respondents payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty 
Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, 
Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the 
Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the 
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be 
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the 
civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related

Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true 
and admitted by David S. Hall, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment 
interest, civil penalty or other amounts due by Hall under this Order or any other judgment, 
order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this 
proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Hall of the federal securities laws or any 
regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the 
Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
