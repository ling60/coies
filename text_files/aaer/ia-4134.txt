                                            I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") deems it appropriate and in 
the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to 
Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act"), against Jonathan D. 
Davey ("Respondent" or "Davey"). 
 
                                            II. 
                                              
       After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that: 
        
       A.     RESPONDENT 
               
              1.     From at least 2001 through May 2009, Davey was the President, Secretary, 
Treasurer, Director, controlling shareholder, and an associated person of Trustar Capital 
Management Inc., later known as Safe Harbor Wealth Investments, Inc. ("Safe Harbor"), an Ohio-
registered investment adviser.  On or about May 28, 2009, Divine Stewardship, LLC ("Divine 
Stewardship") assumed all of Safe Harbor's assets, policies, and management and continued as 
successor to Safe Harbor's business as an Ohio-registered investment adviser.  Davey served as 
Divine Stewardship's Manager and he owned and controlled Divine Stewardship.   
                
              2.     From on or about May 15, 2000 until on or about December 31, 2010, 
Davey maintained an active certified public accountant license from the state of Ohio.

               3.      Davey is 51 years old and is currently incarcerated at the Elkton Federal 
Correctional Institution in Lisbon, Ohio. 
        
       B.      ENTRY OF RESPONDENT'S CRIMINAL CONVICTION 
 
               4.      On February 22, 2012, Davey and three other persons were charged with 
violations of 18 U.S.C. § 371, 18 U.S.C. § 1349, and 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), pursuant to a Bill of 
Indictment (the "Indictment") alleging a securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and 
money laundering conspiracy, which Indictment was filed in the United States District Court for 
the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, in the case of United States of America 
v. Jonathan D. Davey, et al., U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, 
Charlotte Division, Docket No. 3:12-cr-68-RJC.  The Indictment also charged Davey with tax 
evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7201. 
                
               5.      The Indictment alleged, among other things, that:  (a) from approximately 
October 2007 through April 2010, Davey and other persons carried out an investment fraud 
conspiracy by convincing investors in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina and elsewhere to 
invest with the defendants' supposed hedge funds; (b) victims nationwide were defrauded of over 
$40 million; (c) Davey served the conspiracy as an "administrator" for his co-conspirators and as a 
hedge fund manager, and he also lured his own investor victims; (d) Davey used investment 
adviser Safe Harbor and other affiliated entities to collect victim money; and, (e) Davey conspired 
to falsely represent to investor victims that the conspirators had conducted due diligence on 
investments and operated legitimate hedge funds with significant safeguards.  The Indictment 
further alleged that, between August 2008 and February 2011, Davey undertook a number of 
actions to evade the income taxes properly due and owing on the money that Davey stole from 
victims to build his personal mansion. 
                
               6.      On February 8, 2013, after a trial, a jury found Davey guilty of:  (a) 
conspiracy to commit securities fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; (b) conspiracy to commit 
wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349; (c) conspiracy to commit money laundering, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h); and, (d) tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7201. 
                
               7.      On January 15, 2015, the U.S. District Judge in the criminal case sentenced 
Davey to 252  months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered Davey 
to pay over $21.8 million in restitution to defrauded victims and to the Internal Revenue Service.  
On February 4, 2015, the U.S. District Judge signed a Judgment in a Criminal Case against Davey 
(the "Conviction"), ordering the sentence imposed at the hearing. 
 
 
                                               III. 
        
       In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it 
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted 
to determine: 
        

                                                  
                                                2

       A.      Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection 
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations; and,  
        
       B.      What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent 
pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act. 
        
                                                IV. 
        
       IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions 
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an 
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the 
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110. 
         
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations 
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220 
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.  
        
       If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly 
notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against 
him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as 
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.  
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310. 
        
       This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent as provided for in the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice.   
        
       IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  the  Administrative  Law  Judge  shall  issue  an  initial 
decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of 
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.  
        
       In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged 
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related 
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness 
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice.  Since this proceeding is not "rule making" within 
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the 
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action. 
        
       By the Commission.
