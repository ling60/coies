        In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers 
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings

                                               Summary 
 
        IEC Electronics Corp. (“IEC”) filed false financial statements for Q3 2012, FYE 2012, and 
Q1 2013 as a result of misconduct that occurred at IEC’s now-former subsidiary, Southern 
California Braiding, Inc. (“SCB”).  Former SCB controller, Ronald Years, and former IEC 
executive vice president of operations, Donald Doody, engaged in misconduct relating to SCB’s 
work-in-process inventory (“WIP”).  Years made false accounting entries into a WIP spreadsheet 
that Years prepared, and these entries were based in part on amounts provided by Doody to Years 
that were false.  Years and Doody also kept material in WIP that had already been used and added 
inventory to WIP that was missing.  Years and Doody engaged in this misconduct to meet SCB’s 
                                                 
1
 Section 4C provides, in relevant part, that:  
 
        The Commission may censure any person, or deny, temporarily or permanently, to any person the 
privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission in any way, if that person is found . . . to have 
willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any provision of the securities laws or 
the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 
2
 Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) provides, in pertinent part, that: 
 
        The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily   or permanently, the privilege of appearing or 
practicing before it . . . to any person who is found . . .  to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and 
abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations 
thereunder.

budgeted gross profit margins (“GPMs”).  In addition, Years failed to consider the percentage 
completion of WIP and consequently capitalized too many weeks of labor and overhead costs to 
WIP.  As a result of Years’ and Doody’s misconduct, IEC materially understated cost of goods 
sold, and materially overstated gross profit and net income before taxes in its financial statements 
for Q3 2012 and FYE 2012, and, in the case of Years, Q1 2013.  In Q2 2013, IEC’s then-CFO 
discovered potential issues with respect to SCB’s WIP, and after IEC determined that the prior 
accounting was incorrect, it announced the need for a restatement in May 2013 and filed the 
restatement in July 2013.    
 
                                       Respondents 
 
       1.      IEC Electronics Corp., (“IEC”) is a Delaware corporation headquartered in 
Newark, New York.  IEC manufactures, among other things, circuit cards, cable and wire 
harnesses, and sheet metal components that can withstand harsh environments, such as extreme hot 
and cold temperatures.  IEC services the medical, aerospace, defense, industrial, and transportation 
industries.  In February 2015, IEC’s board of directors was replaced with a new board as a result of 
a proxy contest.  The new board terminated the CEO, and elected a new CEO.  IEC’s common 
stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(b) and is listed on 
NYSE MKT under ticker symbol IEC.    
 
       2.      Ronald J. Years, (“Years”) age 52, of La Habra, California, worked for IEC from 
April 2008 through February 2013.  Years was SCB’s controller from May 2011 through February 
2013.  Years has been a licensed CPA in Massachusetts since August 2012. 
        
       3.      Donald S. Doody, (“Doody”) age 49, of Mukilteo, Washington, is the former 
executive vice president of operations for IEC.  Doody worked in operations for IEC from 2004 
through January 2014.

                                             Facts 
 
       A.     Background 
 
       5.     IEC acquired SCB in December 2010.  In May 2011, Years became SCB’s 
controller.  Years reported to IEC’s then-CFO.  In the summer of 2011, IEC’s then-CEO asked 
Doody to become involved in SCB’s operations because SCB was not performing financially as 
IEC’s CEO had expected.  Doody reported directly to IEC’s CEO.   
        
       6.     SCB mainly manufactured custom cables and wire harnesses for the aerospace 
and defense industries.  It took SCB on average about six weeks to assemble/manufacture a 
product for a customer.  SCB’s inventory mainly consisted of raw material and WIP.  WIP 
consists of the material in production, the labor used to produce the product, and a portion of the 
factory overhead.  SCB held few finished goods because when a product was complete, it was 
shipped to the customer.                      
 
       7.     Prior to IEC acquiring SCB, SCB was a privately held company that operated on 
a cash basis and lacked an adequate system of internal accounting controls.  Years worked on 
implementing internal accounting controls over SCB’s inventory.  Years, however, failed to 
implement an adequate system of internal accounting controls for WIP.  Specifically, Years did 
not consider the percentage completion of WIP when he calculated how much labor and 
overhead should be capitalized to WIP at the end of each quarter.  By not considering the 
percentage completion of WIP, Years capitalized too much labor and overhead to WIP and 
inappropriately inflated WIP.  This resulted in the overstatement of labor and overhead in WIP 
and an understatement of cost of goods sold (“COGS”) and an overstatement of gross profit and 
                                                      3
net income before taxes for Q1 2012 through Q1 2013.     IEC’s and SCB’s fiscal year is from 
October 1 through September 30.     
        
       8.     In addition, at the end of Q3 2012, both Years and Doody started inappropriately 
inflating WIP.  At the end of Q3 2012 and Q4 2012, Years made false accounting entries that 
capitalized additional amounts of labor and overhead to WIP, and these entries were based in 
part on amounts provided by Doody to Years that were false.  At the end of Q4 2012, Years and 
Doody also kept material in WIP that had already been used and added inventory to WIP that 
was missing.  Years and Doody engaged in this misconduct to meet SCB’s budgeted GPMs.   
        
       9.     As a result of their misconduct, Years and Doody overstated WIP and materially 
understated COGS and materially overstated gross profit and net income before taxes for Q3 
2012 and FYE 2012, and, in the case of Years, Q1 2013.  Thus, IEC filed a materially false Form 
10-Q for Q3 2012, Form 10-K for FY 2012, and Form 10-Q for Q1 2013.  IEC also filed 
multiple materially false Forms 8-K, and IEC’s earnings calls for Q3 2012 through Q1 2013 
contained materially false information about IEC’s financial results.

 When WIP is overstated on the balance sheet, COGS is understated by the same amount on the income 
statement.  When COGS is understated, then gross profit and net income are overstated on the income 
statement.

       B.     Years and Doody Inflated SCB’s WIP  
 
              i.      Failure to Consider Percentage Completion of WIP 
        
       10.    Years failed to develop a methodology that accurately reflected the value of 
SCB’s WIP because he failed to consider the percentage completion of WIP.  In addition, Years 
did not do any testing on WIP to determine the percentage completion.  Thus, Years failed to 
implement adequate internal accounting controls over WIP, and, and as a result, Years inflated 
WIP from Q1 2012 through Q1 2013.  In addition, there was lack of adequate internal accounting 
controls over the review of Years’ work.  The IEC accounting personnel who reviewed Years’ 
WIP spreadsheet each month failed to see that Years was not considering the percentage 
completion of WIP.  As a result of the lack of internal accounting controls over WIP, IEC had a 
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to WIP.  IEC stated in its 
amended Form 10-K for FYE 2012 that it had this material weakness, and it stated in its Form 
10-Q for Q3 2014 that this material weakness had been remediated.   
        
       11.    SCB’s inventory mainly consisted of raw materials and WIP (SCB held few 
finished goods because generally when a product was complete, it was shipped to the customer).  
SCB’s WIP consisted of material, labor, and overhead.  Although there was a system to track 
material, SCB never developed a system to track the actual amount of labor and overhead 
applied to each job in WIP.  As a result, Years had to determine the appropriate amount of labor 
and overhead to capitalize to WIP each quarter.  From Q2 2011 through Q4 2011, Years 
capitalized four weeks of labor and overhead to WIP each quarter.  Starting in Q1 2012, Years 
developed a methodology to calculate labor and overhead capitalized to WIP.  Years’ 
methodology was captured in a WIP spreadsheet.  Years used this spreadsheet to calculate labor 
and overhead to be capitalized to WIP on a monthly basis.  Years’ methodology, however, failed 
to consider the percentage completion of WIP.  From Q1 2012 through Q4 2012, because Years 
failed to consider the percentage completion of WIP, Years gradually increased the number of 
weeks that he capitalized labor and overhead to WIP from five weeks to eleven weeks.  By the 
end of Q1 2013, Years was capitalizing thirteen weeks of labor and overhead to WIP.   
        
       12.    In each quarter of FY 2012 and Q1 2013, it took SCB on average about six weeks 
to assemble/manufacture a product, and on average a product in WIP was about 25% complete at 
each quarter-end.  This meant that on average only one and a half weeks (six weeks multiplied 
by 25%) of labor and overhead should have been capitalized to WIP at each quarter-end versus 
the five to thirteen weeks that Years was capitalizing to WIP from Q1 2012 through Q1 2013.  
Because Years inappropriately capitalized too many weeks of labor and overhead to WIP, WIP 
was overstated during FY 2012 and for Q1 2013.  
        
       13.    By at least October 2012, prior to SCB filing its FYE 2012 Form 10-K in 
November 2012, Years knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he was capitalizing too many 
                                                  
weeks of labor and overhead to WIP for Q4 2012.

               ii.     False Accounting Entries to WIP in Q3 2012 and Q4 2012  
 
       14.     At quarter-ends Q3 2012 and Q4 2012, WIP was inappropriately inflated through 
false accounting entries that capitalized additional amounts of labor and overhead to WIP.  Years 
made these false accounting entries into his WIP spreadsheet by hard coding, i.e. forcing, these 
amounts into the spreadsheet without any supporting formulas, and these entries were based in part 
on amounts provided by Doody to Years that were false.  Years and Doody engaged in this 
misconduct to meet SCB’s budgeted GPMs for Q3 2012 and FYE 2012.  At the end of Q3 2012, 
the accounting entry capitalized an additional $104,000 of labor and $265,000 of overhead to WIP 
that should not have been capitalized.  At the end of Q4 2012, the accounting entry capitalized an 
additional $124,000 of labor and $346,000 of overhead to WIP that should not have been 
capitalized.  As a result of these entries, inventory was overstated on IEC’s balance sheet, COGS 
was understated on IEC’s income statement, and gross profit and net income before taxes were 
overstated on IEC’s income statement for Q3 2012 and FYE 2012. 
 
       15.     As part of IEC’s FYE 2012 audit, IEC’s auditors asked Years about the $124,000 of 
labor and the $346,000 of overhead added to WIP for Q4 2012.  Years emailed Doody and told 
him that the auditors were asking about the $124,000 of labor and the $346,000 of overhead that 
“doesn’t have backup.”  Years attached to his email a spreadsheet that he created as support for the 
false accounting entry.  He asked Doody if Doody had additional information that Years could use 
to support a percentage number in his spreadsheet.  Years also said, “Going forward we all realize 
we have to do something with this and the other material in WIP.  I will come up with a way to 
make it less visible in the future, but I have to get past this for now.  Thanks for the input.  Last 
thing I have to do… I hope.”  Doody responded to Years by telling him where he could find 
additional information for the percentage number.  Years gathered this additional information and 
sent it and the spreadsheet to the auditors as support for the false accounting entry.     
 
               iii.   Keeping Material in WIP That Already Had Been Used 
 
       16.     In Q4 2012, Years and Doody inappropriately inflated WIP on SCB’s balance sheet 
by keeping material in WIP that already had been used for a SCB customer on two job orders.  
Years kept this material in WIP by not recognizing enough COGS material related to these two job 
orders on SCB’s income statement during FY 2012 and Q1 2013.  As a result of keeping this 
material in WIP, inventory was overstated on IEC’s balance sheet, COGS was understated on 
IEC’s income statement, and gross profit and net income before taxes were overstated on IEC’s 
income statement during FY 2012 and Q1 2013. 
        
       17.     By late August 2012, following a physical inventory count, Years knew, or was 
reckless in not knowing, that at least $312,724 of material related to these two job orders for this 
customer had already been used and no longer existed in inventory.  Years told Doody that this 
$312,724 of material was missing from inventory.  Doody believed that Years was going to write-
off this missing material from SCB’s balance sheet.  Years, however, did not write-off this 
material, and by the end of Q4 2012, the balance grew to $395,138.  In mid and late October 2012, 
prior to IEC filing its Form 10-K for FYE 2012, Years sent Doody emails reminding Doody that 
this inventory was still in WIP at the end of Q4 2012 and “shouldn’t be there.”   

                                                6       
---------------------Page 7---------------------

       18.    As part of IEC’s FYE 2012 audit, IEC’s auditors asked Years about this $395,138 
of material in WIP.  Years did not tell the auditors that the $395,138 of material had already been 
used on jobs shipped to a customer and that this material no longer existed in inventory.  Instead, 
Years, among other things, falsely told the auditors that SCB had not yet shipped these job orders 
to the customer.  Years had emailed Doody and told Doody that the auditors had asked about the 
$395,138 of material still in WIP, and Years also told Doody what he planned to tell the auditors.  
Even though Doody knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that this material was missing from 
inventory and had not been written-off, Doody did not respond to Years and failed to take 
corrective action.   
        
       19.    By the end of Q1 2013, the balance of this material grew to $422,132 because no 
COGS for this material had been recognized by Years.   
        
              iv.     Adding Missing Finished Goods Inventory to WIP 
                    
       20.    Lastly, in Q4 2012, Years and Doody inflated WIP by adding $116,227 of missing 
finished goods inventory (acquired during IEC’s acquisition of SCB) to WIP.  As a result of adding 
this missing finished goods inventory to WIP, inventory was overstated on IEC’s balance sheet, 
COGS was understated on IEC’s income statement, and gross profit and net income before taxes 
were overstated on IEC’s income statement at FYE 2012.   
        
       21.    By late August 2012, following a physical inventory count, Years and Doody knew, 
or were reckless in not knowing, that this finished goods inventory was missing.  In the beginning 
of October 2012, Years emailed Doody seeking direction on what Years should do with the 
$116,227 of missing finished goods, writing, “Should go to [Cost of Goods Sold], or can go to 
WIP…”  Doody responded, “…my sense is WIP for now…”  Years then moved the inventory 
from finished goods inventory to WIP in the general ledger.  In mid and late October 2012, prior to 
IEC filing its Form 10-K for FYE 2012, Years sent Doody emails reminding Doody that this 
missing finished goods inventory (as well as the $395,128 of already used inventory) was still in 
WIP at the end of Q4 2012 and “shouldn’t be there.”   
 
       22.    Years sent the auditors a spreadsheet that showed that Years was writing-off the 
$116,227 of finished goods inventory.  Years, however, did not write-off the $116,227 and instead 
moved the $116,227 into WIP.  Years emailed Doody, informing him that the auditors had asked 
about the $395,138 of missing customer material (discussed above), and added that “[The auditors] 
haven’t seen the $116k of [finished goods] transferred into WIP.”  Doody did not respond to Years 
and failed to take corrective action.    
        
       C.     IEC Restated its FY 2012 and Q1 2013 Financial Statements  
        
       23.    IEC restated its Q1 through Q3 2012, FYE 2012, and Q1 2013 financial 
statements because SCB overstated WIP, gross profit, and net income, and understated COGS.  
In May 2013, IEC filed a Form 8-K that announced the restatement of its financials and provided 
the restated net income amounts for Q1 through Q3 2012, FYE 2012, and Q1 2013.  In July 
2013, IEC filed an amended Form 10-K for FYE 2012 and a Form 10-Q for Q1 2013.  IEC 

                                               7

included its Q1 2012 through Q3 2012 restated financial statements in its amended Form 10-K 
for FYE 2012. 
         
        24.      The table below summarizes the impact of the misstatement on IEC’s net income 
                                                   4
before taxes from Q1 2012 through Q1 2013.            The overstatement of SCB’s WIP was material to

 Q1 2013 
         
        25.      IEC’s FYE 2012 net income before taxes was overstated by $1,521,635, of which 
            6
$924,991,  or 61%, was the result of both Years and Doody inappropriately inflating WIP in 
Q3 2012 and Q4 2012.  The remainder of IEC’s overstated income in FYE 2012 was mainly 
from Years failing to consider the percentage completion of WIP and thus, capitalizing too many 
weeks of labor and overhead to WIP from Q1 2012 through Q4 2012.   
         
        26.     IEC’s Q1 2013 net income before taxes was overstated by $539,060, the majority 
of which was from Years failing to consider the percentage completion of WIP.  The $539,060 
overstatement in Q1 2013 took IEC’s net income before taxes from a profit to a loss for that 
quarter.   
         

                                                 
4
 The restated net income before taxes amounts in this table for Q1 2012, Q4 2012, and FYE 2012 are 
different than the restated amounts reported by IEC for two reasons.  First, for FY 2011, WIP was 
overstated by $245,328.  Because this amount was not material to IEC’s FY 2011 financial statements, 
IEC included this overstatement in its Q1 2012 restated net income before taxes; this $245,328 
overstatement is not included in the table above because the amount related to FY 2011.  Second, during 
the restatement process, IEC did not discover the $116,227 of missing finished goods inventory that 
Years and Doody moved to WIP.  As a result, IEC did not deduct the $116,227 from IEC’s Q4 2012 
restated net income before taxes.  
 
5
 For Q1 2012 through Q1 2013, the restated figures also include     small amounts of additional material 
that IEC wrote -off from WIP and deducted from net income      before taxes .  For FYE 2012 and Q1 2013, 
IEC wrote -off additional material of $70,408 and $74,068, respectively.    
 
6
 The total $924,991 i s arrived at by adding th e  Q4 2012 false   accounting entry of $124,000 of labor and 
$346,000 of overhead, plus the $395,138 of material that had already been shipped and no longer existed 
in WIP but was still held in WIP (less an inventory reserve of $56,374), plus the $116,227 of    missing 
finished goods inventory that was moved to WIP.     
 
                                                      8       
---------------------Page 9---------------------

       27.     As a result, IEC filed a materially false Form 10-Q for Q3 2012, Form 10-K for 
FY 2012, and Form 10-Q for Q1 2013.  IEC also filed multiple false Forms 8-K for Q3 2012 
                  7
through Q1 2013.    In addition, IEC’s earnings calls for Q3 2012, Q4 2012 / FYE 2012, and Q1 
2013 contained false information about IEC’s financial results, including its net income.   
        
       D.     Later Developments at IEC 
 
       28.     Both Years and Doody no longer work for IEC.  Years left IEC in February 2013, 
and Doody voluntarily left in January 2014.  IEC is also under new management, including a new 
CEO and new Board of Directors, as a result of activist shareholders waging a proxy battle in early 
2015.  In addition, IEC no longer owns SCB; IEC sold SCB in July 2015 to a privately held 
company.

Commission, Los Angeles Regional Office, 444 South Flower Street, Suite 900, Los Angeles, 
California 90071.   
 
       J.      Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be 
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes.  To 
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor 
Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of 
any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondents’ payment of a civil 
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”).  If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a 
Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order 
granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of 
the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Such a payment shall not be 
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil 
penalty imposed in this proceeding.  For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” 
means a private damages action brought against Respondents by or on behalf of one or more 
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the 
Commission in this proceeding. 
 
                                                V. 

       It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section 
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by 
Respondents Years and Doody, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil 
penalty or other amounts due by Respondents Years and Doody under this Order or any other 
judgment, order, consent order, decree, or settlement agreement entered in connection with this 
proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Respondents Years and Doody of the federal securities 
laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the 
Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
