Respondent.                                    AND RULE 102(e) OF THE COMMISSION’S 
                                                                   
                                                 
 
 
                                            I. 
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission  (“Commission”)  deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest to accept the Offer of Settlement submitted by Jason Maiher (“Maiher” or 
“Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 240(a) of the Rules of Practice of the Commission,  17 C.F.R. § 
201.240(a), for the purpose of settlement of these proceedings initiated  against Respondent on 
February 23, 2016, pursuant to Sections 4C, 15(b), and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (“Exchange Act”) and 102(e)(1)(iii)  of the Commission’s  Rules of Practice. 
 

                                           II. 
 
      Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on 
behalf of the Commission,  or to which the Commission  is a party, and without admitting  or 
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s  jurisdiction  over him and the subject

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Making Findings,  and Imposing Remedial 
Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 4C, 15(b) and 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s  Rules of Practice (“Order”), as set 
forth below. 
                            

 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

 
                                              III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:  
 
A.     SUMMARY 
 
       1.     These proceedings concern Respondent’s role in KeyBanc Capital Market Inc.’s 
(“KBCM”) failure to make and keep accurate books and records. 
        
       2.     Beginning  at some point prior to January 2011, and through January 2012, 
Respondent, who was KBCM’s CFO (until November 2011) and Series 27 Financial and 
Operations Principal (“FinOp”), directed that unsubstantiated entries (commonly  known as “plug” 
entries) be made to one or more accounts in KBCM’s general ledger, in order to complete 
KBCM’s monthly  close-the-books process. 
        
       3.     The plug entries resulted in KBCM overstating its assets and income in the 
financial statements included in its fiscal year 2010 Annual Audited Report filed with the 
Commission  in February 2011, and also resulted in inaccurate financial information  being included 
in KBCM’s monthly  reporting to FINRA (which furnished such monthly reports to the 
Commission),  including  those filed in 2011and January 2012. 
 
       4.     In its Annual Audited Report for the year ended December 31, 2011, KBCM 
disclosed that its prior period financial statements (for fiscal year 2010) included  unsubstantiated 
assets of $13,679,000  ($8,591,000  net of taxes).  Specifically,  the 2011 Annual Audited Report 
stated “[t]he December 31, 2010, Statement of Financial Condition  included $13,679[,000]  in net 
trade date receivables that was found to be unsubstantiated during 2011.”   
 
B.     RESPONDENT 
 
       5.     Maiher, age 42, was KBCM’s CFO from April 2007 through November 2011 and 
FinOp from April 2007 through December 2011.  Maiher was primarily  responsible for 
maintaining  KBCM’s financial records.  He submitted KBCM’s Annual Audited Report to the 
Commission  and oversaw the filing  of its monthly  Financial and Operational Combined Uniform 
Single Reports (“FOCUS Reports”) with FINRA, which then furnished the FOCUS Reports to the 
Commission.   Pursuant to internal policies and procedures that were applicable to KBCM, Maiher 
was required to certify after the close of each month that KBCM’s general ledger balance sheet 
information  had been compared with, and reconciled to, the underlying  back-office system 
information.    
 

                                                 
                                               2 
---------------------Page 3---------------------

 
C.     RELEVANT ENTITY 

 
       6.     KBCM is a broker-dealer registered with the Commission and is a subsidiary of 
KeyCorp, a financial services company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. 
 
D.     FACTS 
 
                 KBCM’S BOOKS AND RECORDS WERE INACCURATE 
 
       7.     Beginning  at some point prior to January 2011, and through January 2012, 
Respondent directed that unsubstantiated (i.e., “plug”) entries be made to one or more accounts in 
KBCM’s general ledger, in order to complete KBCM’s monthly  close-the-books process.  The 
amount of these entries varied over time. 
        
       8.     The plug entries resulted in KBCM overstating its assets and income in its fiscal 
year 2010 financial statements, which were included in its fiscal year 2010 Annual Audited Report 
filed with the Commission  in February 2011.  Respondent signed this report, affirming that the 
accompanying financial statements were “true and correct.” 
        
       9.     The plug entries to the general ledger also resulted in inaccurate financial 
information  being included  in KBCM’s FOCUS Reports that Respondent caused to be filed with 
FINRA, which then furnished the FOCUS Reports to the Commission,  for some point prior to 
January 2011 through January 2012.  In 2012, KBCM filed amended FOCUS Reports.   
        
       10.    In its Annual Audited Report for the year ended December 31, 2011, KBCM 
disclosed that its prior period financial statements (for fiscal year 2010) included  unsubstantiated 
assets of $13,679,000  ($8,591,000  net of taxes).  Specifically,  the 2011 Annual Audited Report 
stated “[t]he December 31, 2010, Statement of Financial Condition  included $13,679[,000]  in net 
trade date receivables that was found to be unsubstantiated during 2011.”   
        
            RESPONDENT DIRECTED THAT UNSUBSTANTIATED ENTRIES  
                        BE MADE TO KBCM’S GENERAL LEDGER 
        
                                                        1
       11.    KeyCorp’s written policies and procedures   that were applicable to KBCM required 
KBCM’s finance department, led by Respondent, to reconcile certain general ledger accounts to 
the back office securities trading and inventory software system.  The general ledger system was 
referred to as MSA.  MSA was the source of the official books and records of KBCM.  The back 
office system for KBCM was referred to as Broadridge.   
        
       12.    The purpose of reconciling accounts was to ensure that the information  in MSA 
was accurate.  Generally, reconciliation  is an accounting process used to compare two sets of 
                                               
1
  These   include  d  “Policy ACC-403:  KeyCorp Reconciliation  and Certification  Policy” and 
“Procedure AR-5001:  Reconcilement  Process & Account Certification.” 
                                                 
                                               3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

 
records to ensure the figures are in agreement.  During the relevant period, KeyCorp’s 
Reconcilement Process & Account Certification Procedure stated that the goal of reconciliation 
was “to verify that the balance and activity in the [general ledger] account agrees with the expected 
balance and activity as recorded elsewhere.”  This document further explained that “[w]hen 
external reports are published  to our shareholders and government agencies, it is critical that the 
general ledger system from which those reports are prepared be correct.” 
        
       13.    The applicable policies and procedures required accounts to be reconciled on a 
periodic basis, which was generally daily or weekly “unless the account has very low transaction 
volume.”  At a minimum,  all accounts were to be reconciled monthly. 
        
       14.    Among the accounts that Respondent and his team were required to reconcile were 
the firm’s inventory accounts.  Despite the fact that the inventory accounts did not have “very low 
transaction volume,” they were reconciled only monthly.  
        
       15.    The applicable policies and procedures required Respondent to segregate the duties 
of preparing, reviewing,  and certifying the inventory accounts reconciliations.  Accordingly,  one of 
KBCM’s accountants was responsible for preparing the reconciliations,  KBCM’s Controller was 
responsible for reviewing the reconciliations,  and Respondent was responsible for certifying them.  
Specifically,  Respondent was responsible for timely  certifying the inventory accounts in 
KeyCorp’s On-Line Certification System. 
        
       16.    As explained in KeyCorp’s policies and procedures, Respondent’s certification of a 
general ledger account was a formal attestation that:  properly documented controls and procedures 
were in place; reconciliations  were routinely performed according to an established schedule; the 
reconciliation  for the account was current; and the supporting  sub-system, which is Broadridge in 
this instance, was in agreement with the general ledger. 

       17.    Further, as stated in the policies and procedures, by certifying an account, 
Respondent was making himself “personally  accountable for the integrity of the account” and 
stating that “a formal reconciliation,  with all pertinent documentation, has been prepared and 
reviewed, and that all reconciling  items have been adequately documented.” 
        
       18.    As part of KBCM’s reconciliation process, any difference between related account 
balances in MSA and Broadridge needed to be identified  and was considered a reconciling item.  
Reconciling  items needed to be researched and resolved within established time limits.   The 
inventory accounts were subject to a 30-day aging period, after which any unresolved differences 
between MSA and Broadridge were to be written off consistent with KeyCorp policy.  The 
approval needed to charge off an item depended on the dollar amount.  Respondent’s write-off 
authority was capped at $100,000  per KeyCorp policy.  Stale items in excess of $100,000  were 
only to be written off with the approval of KeyCorp’s Chief Accounting Officer, CFO, or 
Corporate Controller. 
        
       19.    If a reconciling item was deemed a “reportable exception,” it needed to be recorded 
in the on-line certification system.  A “reportable exception” was defined as a reconciling  item 
                                                  
                                                 4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

 
“deemed significant  enough to alert senior management to a potential problem which may indicate 
a breakdown of internal controls or present the possibility  of significant loss.”  Variances between 
MSA and Broadridge of $10,000  or more, which had not cleared through the normal transaction 
life cycle, fell into this category. 

       20.    It was Respondent’s responsibility,  as certifier of the inventory accounts, to 
describe any reportable exception in clear language, explain the efforts being made to correct the 
exception, and provide the anticipated date of resolution.  Respondent had until  the 20th of each 
month to timely  certify the prior-month  inventory account balances and document any reportable 
exceptions in the on-line certification system.   
        
       21.    Beginning  at some point prior to 2011, and through January 2012, Respondent 
directed that unsubstantiated entries be made to the general ledger in order to balance and be able 
to close the books on a monthly  basis.   

       22.    During 2010, 2011, and January 2012, as part of the monthly close-the-books 
process, at Respondent’s direction,  the staff accountant populated the reconciliation  spreadsheet for 
the inventory accounts.  The initial  iteration of this spreadsheet showed the variances between the 
general ledger and Broadridge.  At Respondent’s direction,  the staff accountant also prepared a 
corresponding “correcting entry” spreadsheet that, in more summary fashion, compared the month-
end MSA long and short inventory balances with the long and short inventory trade date balances 
in Broadridge.  The “correcting entry” spreadsheet was a tool that served as the basis for a series of 
manual adjusting  entries that were then made to the general ledger to make the general ledger 
match Broadridge.  These adjusting entries were described as “Trade Date Long” or “Trade Date 
Short” and were made to the 129186 “Trading Inv-Other” and 273500 “Liab for Shrt Positions” 
accounts.  After these entries were posted to the general ledger, the staff accountant updated the 
reconciliation  spreadsheet; certain variances that appeared on the pre-close version of the 
spreadsheet were thus absent from the final version that was signed by Respondent as certifier, 
post-close. 

       23.    The securities inventory reconciliation  and the related “correcting entry” 
spreadsheet also computed manual adjustments that were made each month to general ledger 
accounts 196727 “Trade Date Receivable” and 299220 “Trade Date Payable.”  Respondent 
directed these adjustments, in combination  with the manual adjustments to accounts 129186 and 
273500, to be made in order to purportedly  reflect the MSA inventory account balances on a trade 
date basis for regulatory reporting purposes. 

       24.    If all of the month-end adjusting entries did not result in MSA balancing, the staff 
accountant, at Respondent’s direction, would include an additional  adjusting entry to plug the 
unexplained  difference in order to be able to close the books in the firm’s internal system.  In most 
instances, Respondent directed that this entry be described as a “Trade Date Adjustment.”  All of 
the manual adjusting entries were typically made on either day 1 or day 2 after the month-end and 
the books were closed on day 3. 

        

                                                  
                                                 5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

 
        

       25.    Below are additional  adjusting  entries that were made to balance and close the 
books monthly  for December 2010 through December 2011: 

 DATE         ACCOUNT                          ENTRY           DESCRIPTION 
 Dec. 2010    482434 P/L                       76,754.36       Inventory Adjustment

 Oct. 2011    129186 Trading Inv-Other         31,618,733.55  Trade Date Adjustment 
 Nov. 2011    196727 Trade Date Receivable     22,170,007.11  Trade Date Adjustment 
 Dec. 2011    196727 Trade Date Receivable     18,674,052.00  Trade Date Adjustment 
                                                                
       26.    Although the purpose of the KBCM inventory reconciliation  process was to 
identify,  research and timely resolve any differences between corresponding account balances in 
MSA and the Broadridge subsystem, through the process undertaken by Respondent and his staff, 
differences were routinely eliminated through the expedient of adjusting  entries made during the 
monthly  close, after which the inventory account balances were certified by Respondent as 
reconciled.  For example, for February, March, April and June 2011, Respondent certified the 
inventory accounts without an exception of any kind.  For other months, he certified with certain 
exceptions but did not disclose that unsubstantiated adjustments had been made to the general 
ledger. 
        
       27.    By coming up with the process by which the reconciler determined the adjusting 
entries, directing that they be made to the general ledger, and then certifying the inventory account 
reconciliations,  Respondent also failed to ensure appropriate segregation of duties, in violation  of 
the applicable policies and procedures. 
        
       28.    KBCM hired a new CFO in November 2011.  After he was hired, the new CFO 
discovered the variances after reviewing the most recent reconciliations and notified  KBCM’s and 
KeyCorp’s management.  Respondent was subsequently terminated from KBCM in May 2012. 
        
       29.    Through the conduct described above, Respondent caused unsubstantiated entries to 
be made in the records of KBCM; caused the records of KBCM to be inaccurate; caused false 
FOCUS Reports and financial statements to be filed with FINRA, which then furnished the 
FOCUS Reports to the Commission;  and caused a false Annual Audited Report to be filed with the 
Commission. 
                              

                                                
                                               6 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

 
E.     VIOLATIONS 
 
       30.    As a result of the conduct described above Respondent willfully  aided and abetted 
and caused KBCM’s violations  of Sections 17(a) and 17(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-
3(a)(2), 17a-5(a), and 17a-5(d) thereunder, which require registered broker-dealers to make and 
keep accurate records, including  current ledgers reflecting all assets and liabilities  relating to the 
firm’s business, and to make and disseminate accurate reports prescribed by Commission  rule, 
including  a balance sheet and income statement certified by a public accounting firm, annual 
audited reports, and periodic FOCUS Reports.   
 
F.     FINDINGS 
 
       31.    Based on the foregoing, the Commission  finds that Respondent Maiher willfully 
aided and abetted and caused KBCM’s violations  of Sections 17(a) and 17(e) of the Exchange Act 
and Rules 17a-3(a)(2), 17a-5(a), and 17a-5(d) thereunder. 
 
G.     CIVIL PENALTIES 
 
       Respondent has submitted  a sworn Statement of Financial  Condition  dated May 19, 2016, 
and other evidence and has asserted his inability  to pay a civil  penalty. 
 
                                                IV. 
        
       In view of the foregoing, the Commission  deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer. 
        
       Accordingly,  it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately,  that: 
        
       A.      Respondent Maiher shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations 
and any future violations of Sections 17(a) and 17(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3(a)(2), 
17a-5(a), and 17a-5(d) promulgated thereunder. 
 
       B.      Respondent Maiher be, and hereby is: 
        
                       barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, 
                       municipal  securities dealer, municipal  advisor, transfer agent, or nationally 
                       recognized statistical rating organization; and  
                
                       barred from participating  in any offering of a penny stock, including: 
                       acting as a promoter,  finder, consultant,  agent or other person who 
                       engages in activities  with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the 
                       issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing  or attempting  to induce 
                       the purchase or sale of any penny stock; 
                        

                                                  
                                                 7 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

 
                       with the right to apply for reentry after two (2) years to the appropriate self-
                       regulatory organization,  or if there is none, to the Commission.  
 
       C.      Any reapplication for association by the Respondent will  be subject to the 
applicable laws and regulations governing  the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned 
upon a number of factors, including,  but not limited  to, the satisfaction of any or all of the 
following:   (a) any disgorgement ordered against the Respondent, whether or not the Commission 
has fully  or partially  waived payment of such disgorgement; (b) any arbitration award related to the 
conduct that served as the basis for the Commission  order; (c) any self-regulatory organization 
arbitration award to a customer, whether or not related to the conduct that served as the basis for 
the Commission  order; and (d) any restitution order by a self-regulatory organization,  whether or 
not related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission  order. 
        
       D.      Respondent Maiher is denied the privilege  of appearing or practicing before the 
Commission  as an accountant.   
 
       E.      After two (2) years from the date of this order, Respondent Maiher may 
request that the Commission  consider his reinstatement by submitting  an application 
(attention: Office of the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the 
Commission  as an accountant. 
  
       F.      Based upon Respondent Maiher’s sworn representations in his Statement of 
Financial Condition  dated May 19, 2016 and other documents submitted to the Commission,  the 
Commission  is not imposing  a penalty against Respondent. 
 
       G.      The Division  of Enforcement (“Division”)  may, at any time following  the entry of 
this Order, petition  the Commission  to: (1) reopen this matter to consider whether Respondent 
provided accurate and complete financial information  at the time such representations were made; 
and (2) seek an order directing payment of the maximum  civil penalty allowable under the law.  
No other issue shall be considered in connection with this petition other than whether the financial 
information  provided by Respondent was fraudulent, misleading,  inaccurate, or incomplete in any 
material respect.  Respondent may not, by way of defense to any such petition:  (1) contest the 
findings  in this Order; (2) assert that payment of a penalty should not be ordered; (3) contest the 
imposition  of the maximum  penalty allowable under the law; or (4) assert any defense to liability 
or remedy, including,  but not limited  to, any statute of limitations  defense.

       It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section 
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by 
Respondent,  and  further,  any  debt  for  disgorgement,  prejudgment  interest, civil penalty or other 
amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree or 
settlement  agreement  entered  in  connection  with  this  proceeding,  is  a  debt  for  the violation by 
Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set 
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
