GlaxoSmithKline Pays $20 Million Penalty to Settle  FCPA Violations 
 
September 30, 2016  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that 
GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) has agreed to pay $20 million to settle charges that it violated the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its China -based subsidiaries  engaged in pay-to-
prescribe schemes to increase sales . 
 
An SEC investigation found that the schemes spanned a period of years and involved the transfer 
of money, gifts, and other things of value to health care professionals, which led to millions of 
dollars in increased  sales of  GSK pharmaceutical products to Chinas state health institutions.  
The participants included certain complicit sales and marketing  managers within  GSKs China -
based subsidiaries.  GSK  failed to devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting 
controls and lacked an effective anti-corruption compliance program to detect and prevent these 
schemes.  As a result, the improper payments were not accurately reflected in GSKs books and 
records. 
 
The SECs order finds that GSK violated the FCPAs internal controls and books -and-records 
provisions.  GSK consented to the order without admitting or denying the findings, and agreed to 
pay a $20 million civil penalty.  GSK also agreed to provide status reports to the SEC  for the 
next two years on its remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures.
