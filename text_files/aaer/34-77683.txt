ORDER DENYING MOTION TO LIFT TEMPORARY SUSPENSION 
AND DIRECTING THAT A HEARING BE HELD 

        On February 25, 2016, we instituted administrative proceedings against Timothy 
                                                                        1
Quintanilla, CPA, under Commission Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(i)(A),     and  temporar il y 
suspen  ded  him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant (the 
“Order”), based on his having been enjoined from violating antifraud and related provisions of 
                          2
the federal securities laws.  Quintanilla now requests   that we lift that suspension for 30 days to 
give him time to “wind up his public audit practice . . . .”  For the reasons discussed below, we 
deny Quintanilla’s request.  We will leave the temporary suspension in place and set the matter 
down for a hearing before an administrative law judge in accordance with Rule of Practice 
              3
102(e)(3)(iii).

                                                     2 

 

                                               I.      Facts 

        In November 2012, we brought a civil action against Quintanilla alleging that he violated 
the securities laws by misrepresenting that the 2006 through 2008 financial statements of 
Electronic Game Card, Inc. (“EGMI”) were audited in accordance with Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) standards, and that those statements “present[ed] 
                                                                 4
fairly, in all material respects,” EGMI’s financial position.        The  civil complaint alleged that 
Quintanilla and his audit team failed to investigate red flags that would have uncovered fraud in 
EGMI   ’s financial statements, and that they failed to audit significant portions of EGMI’s balance 
      5
sheet.    The  complaint further  alleged that , to  conceal their audit failures, employees under 
Quintanilla ’s supervision created and backdated documents for the EGMI audit file shortly 
                                6
before a PCAOB inspection.        

        On December 4     , 2015,   Quintanilla consented to entry by   the  district court of a final 
judgment permanently enjoin      ing  him  from future violations of Sections    10(b), 10A(a)(1), and 
10A(b)(1) of the   Securities Exchange Act     of 1934  , and   Exchange Act  Rule  10b -5 , and  
                                                7
Section   17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.      Based on that injunction,   we  issued the Order 
temporar  il y suspend ing  Quintanilla, and  ordered  that  the temporary  suspension become 
permanent unless    Quintanilla  filed a petition to lift it within 30  days after service of the O rder .  
The Order further provided that,    if Quintanilla filed  such a petition,  we  would  “either lift the 
                                                                               8
temporary suspension, or set the matter down for hearing . . .  or both.”  

        On March 25, 2016, Quintanilla filed a petition to lift his temporary suspension.  
Quintanilla does not challenge our authority to impose the temporary suspension and states that, 
when he consented to the injunction, he “understood that the SEC would subsequently seek a 
permanent bar . . . which was agreed to during settlement discussions.”  Rather, Quintanilla 
requests that we lift the temporary suspension for 30 days so that his “issuer client can file [its] 
quarterly report on Form 10-Q which work [Quintanilla] began performing prior to receiving the 
Order.”  After the 30 day period, Quintanilla states that “the Commission may enter a permanent 
bar against” him.  The Division of Enforcement opposes Quintanilla’s petition asserting, among 
other things, that Quintanilla’s conduct involved egregious fraud over a three year period and 
that he has offered no “evidence recognizing his wrongdoing” or “any assurances against future 
violations.”

                                         II.     Discussion 

       Rule 102(e)(3)(iii) provides that, upon receipt of a timely petition to lift a temporary 
suspension, “the Commission shall either lift the temporary suspension, or set the matter down 
for hearing at a time and place designated by the Commission, or both, and, after opportunity for 
hearing, may censure the petitioner or disqualify the petitioner from appearing or practicing 
                                                                9
before the Commission for a period of time or permanently.”   We have determined to deny 
Quintanilla’s request to lift the temporary suspension for 30 days, and to instead set the matter 
down for a hearing.  In issuing the Order, we found it “appropriate and in the public interest” to 
temporarily suspend Quintanilla because he had been permanently enjoined from violating the 
federal securities laws.  Quintanilla has provided no reason to question that conclusion. 

       Instead, Quintanilla contends that, when he consented to the injunction in district court, 
he was not advised that the Commission would issue a temporary suspension, and understood 
that he “would have time to wind up his public audit practice and would receive notice when the 
Commission initiated its permanent bar proceedings.”  But Quintanilla, who continues to be 
                                                                                     10
represented by the same counsel who represented him in the district court action,       does not 
explain the basis for his understanding, and, in any event, he was on notice of   the  Rule 102(e) (3)  
procedures th at we  follow   in imposing the temporary suspension  .   Those procedures contemplate 
entry of   a temporary suspension under Rule 102(e)(3)(i) within 90 days of the entry of final 
          11
judgment.     Quintanilla’s asserted reason for lifting the suspension is to provide him time to 
review an issuer’s 10-Q filing; in light of the serious allegations in the civil complaint and his 
                                                                                                     12
consent to a final judgment in that proceeding, it would be inappropriate to permit him to do so.        
Other than stating that he worked on this fi ling prior to the Order’s entry, he provides no 
assurances or evidence that his demonstrated inability to properly comply with the securities 
laws would not impact this issuer or other clients in the remainder of his public audit practice.

       17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3)(iii).

       SEC v. Cole, et al., No. 12-cv-8167 (RJS) (S.D.N.Y.). 
11
       See 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3) (“No order of temporary suspension shall be entered by the 
Commission pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this rule more than 90 days after the date on 
which the final judgment or order entered in a judicial or administrative proceeding described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) or (e)(3)(i)(B) has become effective . . . .”).  We temporarily suspended 
Quintanilla 83 days after the final judgment. 
12
       In its opposition to Quintanilla’s motion, the Division “respectfully submits that the 
Commission should . . . issue an order permanently barring him from appearing or practicing 
before the Commission.”  Our rules, however, do not contemplate the imposition of such 
sanction at this stage, before a hearing has been held and a decision by a law judge issued.  See 
Rule 102(e)(3)(iii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3)(iii).  We do not mean to suggest any view as to the 
outcome of this proceeding.

Inconvenience to his ability to wind down his audit practice does not change our view that a 
                                                      13
temporary suspension remains in the public interest.    

       Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that       Timothy Quintanilla, CPA    ’s petition to lift the 
temporary suspension is denied, and that the temporary suspension will remain in effect pending 
a hearing and decision in this matter; it is further 

       ORDERED that this proceeding be set down for a public hearing before an administrative 
law judge in accordance with Commission Rule of Practice 110.  As specified in Rule of Practice 
102(e)(3)(iii), the hearing shall be expedited in accordance with Rule of Practice 500; and it is 
further 

       ORDERED that the administrative law judge shall file an initial decision no later than 
210 days from the date of service of this order. 

       By the Commission.
