                                         RESPONDENT 

       1.      Icon is an unregistered investment manager organized as a limited  liability 
company (“LLC”) under the laws of Delaware and based in New York, New York.  Today Icon is 
wholly  owned by ICON Investment Group, LLC, a closely held corporation.  During the relevant 
period, Icon’s primary activity was the development,  marketing, sponsorship and investment 
management of a series of equipment leasing funds (“Icon Leasing Funds” or “Leasing Funds”), 
which have registered their securities offerings pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and whose 
securities are registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  Each Icon Leasing Fund was 
organized as a separate entity and was subject to the periodic reporting obligations  of Section 13 of 
the Exchange Act and related rules.  The Leasing Fund interests are not publicly  traded. 

                                RELEVANT FUND ENTITIES 

       2.      The Leasing Funds relevant to this proceeding are Icon Income Fund Nine, LLC 
(“Fund 9”), Icon Income Fund Ten, LLC (“Fund 10”), Icon Leasing Fund Eleven, LLC (“Fund 
11”), and Icon Leasing Fund Twelve, LLC (“Fund 12”), which were formed by Icon as Delaware 
LLCs between 2001 and 2007.  Each of the four Leasing Funds had a principal  place of business in 
New York, New York and filed periodic reports pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act.  
Funds 9, 10, 11 and 12 held portfolios  that included,  among other things, tankers and container 
vessels, aircraft, auto and refrigeration equipment,  rail support construction equipment, and 
telecommunications  assets.  During the period at issue here, reported fund assets ranged up to $621 
million  (Fund 12), with reported annual net income ranging from a profit of $13 million  (Fund 12) 
to a loss of $45 million  (Fund 11), on reported annual revenues of up to $103 million  (Fund 11). 

                                              FACTS 

Overview 

       3.      Over a number of years, Icon made accounting errors that resulted in material 
inaccuracies in periodic reports filed by the four Icon Leasing Funds identified  above.  Due to 
inadequate internal accounting controls and the misapplication  of Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (“GAAP”) in certain instances, Icon did not report accurately financial results, and had 
inaccuracies in books and records, for these four Leasing Funds from 2009 through 2012.  Icon’s 
accounting errors resulted in, among other things,  one or more of the relevant Leasing Funds not 
taking certain required asset value impairments,  overstating post-impairment  values or overstating 
residual values in multiple  reporting periods.  As a result, there were material inaccuracies in 
financial statements for the relevant Leasing Funds for annual and interim periods from 2009 
through 2011, and some of these inaccurate financial results also appeared in the relevant Leasing 

                                               
1
       T he findings  herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not 
binding  on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

Funds’ periodic reports for 2012.  Icon’s errors resulted in overstatements of net income (or 
understatements of net loss) and overstated asset and Leasing Fund members’ equity values in the 
amounts set forth herein.  As detailed below, Icon was therefore a cause of violations  of Sections 
13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B)  of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 
                                                2
thereunder by the relevant Leasing Funds.         

Background 

        4.      Icon markets each Leasing Fund to investors at the Leasing Fund’s inception 
through various broker-dealers, acquires and manages the Leasing Fund’s assets, and then winds 
down the Leasing Fund after a set period of time.  By design, the Leasing Funds have limited  life 
spans, beginning  with an offering period, followed by an operational period and then a liquidation 
period.  Each Leasing Fund sells interests to investors only during that Leasing Fund’s initial 
offering period, and the Leasing Fund interests are not traded thereafter in a secondary trading 
market, public  or private.  By contract, the ability  of Leasing Fund investors to sell, transfer or 
redeem their interests during the operational and liquidation  periods was limited,  and all such 
actions were subject to Icon’s approval.  Each Leasing Fund typically  begins filing  its periodic 
reports after its registration statement is declared effective by the SEC (as the Leasing Funds at 
issue here did).  Icon performs all of the accounting functions for each Leasing Fund, including  the 
preparation of each Leasing Fund’s financial statements and periodic reports. 

        5.      During the relevant period, one of Icon’s primary investment strategies for a 
number of the Leasing Funds, including  the four Leasing Funds at issue in this proceeding, was to 
purchase shipping  vessels and lease the vessels to commercial shipping  companies.  The Leasing 
Funds collected the rental income, as well as the sale or other proceeds from the disposal of the 
vessels and other Leasing Fund assets.  Icon, in turn, received management and acquisition  fees 
from each Leasing Fund, calculated on the basis of rental payments received by the Leasing Fund 
and acquisition  prices of assets.  Icon waived some or all of the management and acquisition  fees 
and expense reimbursement payments due from three of the four Leasing Funds at issue during the 
relevant period.

        Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers whose securities are registered with 
the Commission  under       the Exchange Act to file periodic  reports with the Commission  containing 
such information  as the Commission  prescribes by rule, and the information  contained in such 
reports is required to be   complete and     accurate.  Exchange Act Rule 13a       -1 requires regist  rants to 
file annual reports on Form 10     -K, and Rule 13a    -13 requires issuers to file quarterly reports on 
Form 10  -Q.  Rule 12b   -20  provides that these reports must contain,  in addition  to disclosures 
expressly required by the pertinent statutes and rules, su       ch other information  as is necessary to 
ensure that the statements made in the report are not, under the circumstances, materially 
misleading.   Section 13(b)(2)(A) requires registrants to make and keep books, records and 
accounts which, in reasonable detai      l,  accurately and fairly  reflect transactions and dispositions  of 
assets.  Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires registrants to devise and maintain  a system of internal 
accounting  controls sufficient to provide  reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded a             s 
necessary to permit preparation of financial  statements in accordance with GAAP and to 
maintain  accountability  for assets.    

                                                        3  
---------------------Page 4---------------------

       6.      The values of the shipping  and other assets owned by the Leasing Funds, including 
each of the vessels described below, were recorded on each Leasing Fund’s books at cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation.  This value was referred to as the assets’ “carrying value” or “net book 
value.”  Icon personnel were responsible for regularly reviewing carrying values and determining 
whether those values were recoverable from (i.e. were equaled or exceeded by) estimated future 
cash flows from the asset.  Under GAAP, Icon was required to perform such a “recoverability  test” 
on each asset any time there was an “indicator of impairment,”  such as an appraisal below book 
value or the renegotiation of lease terms.  ASC 360-10-35-21.  If the carrying value is estimated not 
to be recoverable, GAAP requires that an impairment  loss be recorded, measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value, with the fair value recorded as the new 
carrying value.  ASC 360-10-35-17.   Under GAAP, fair value is defined as the “price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date.”  ASC 820-10-20.    Under GAAP, Icon was also required to 
evaluate the “residual” values of the Leasing Funds’ assets (i.e. an estimate of the remaining sale or 
scrap values at the end of a vessel’s life) and adjust residual values when necessary.  ASC 360-10-
35-22. 

       7.      In early 2009, the drastic downturn in the world economy following  the global 
financial crisis and other economic factors resulted in a significant  drop in shipping  lease rates and 
vessel sale prices.  Although shipping  lease rates and vessel sale prices were historically  volatile, 
often with significant swings in both directions within relatively short periods of time, the steep 
downturn in the market triggered by the financial crisis did not follow historical patterns and 
continued unabated for years.  The daily lease rates, known as “spot market rates,” did not return to 
even the lower end of the typical range of pre-2009 levels until the end of 2014 and stayed well 
below recent historic lows throughout most of this period.  In response to the depressed market, 
and after discussions with the Leasing Funds’ outside auditor, Icon adopted a methodology  known 
as the Hamburg Ship Evaluation  Standard (“Hamburg Method”) for certain accounting purposes in 
2009. 

       8.      The Hamburg Method was developed by members of the shipping  industry in early 
2009 and relies on ten-year historical average prices to estimate future lease rates and scrap values.  
The average prices used for the Hamburg Method are based on industry-wide averages provided by 
an independent research resource and adjusted both for the type and age of the specific vessel in 
question and for the costs and expenses associated with leasing those vessels.  In addition  to using 
those averages, the Hamburg Method uses historical ten-year averages of bond and equity 
premium rates in arriving at the rate at which to discount estimated future cash flows.   

       9.      As detailed below, Icon’s reliance on the Hamburg Method to make fair value 
determinations in situations where it possessed relevant contemporaneous market data contravened 
GAAP and, along with other accounting errors and internal accounting control lapses, resulted in 
Icon's not taking certain necessary impairments, overstating post-impairment  values and 
overstating residual values, causing numerous material inaccuracies in the publicly  filed financial 
statements and periodic reports for Funds 9, 10, 11 and 12 from 2009 through 2012.  During this 
period, Icon also omitted certain disclosures required under GAAP relating to certain of the 
Leasing Funds’ residual values and made inaccurate disclosures related to the methodology  used 
for the Leasing Funds’ equity valuation  mandated under ERISA.

Improper Impairment of the Mayon and Samar Vessels 

       10.    Icon erred by not taking an impairment  charge with respect to two vessels owned 
and leased out by Funds 9, 10 and 12 (the Mayon and Samar) at the end of the Leasing Funds’ 
2010 fiscal year and then failing  to take the appropriate impairment  for both vessels in the first 
quarter of 2011.  As a result, the recorded values of the Mayon and the Samar was overstated on 
the books and records of these three Leasing Funds starting as of December 31, 2010, which led to 
inaccuracies in periodic reports subsequently filed by the three Leasing Funds. 

       Non-Impairment of the Vessels at Year End 2010 

       11.    The Mayon and the Samar were both scheduled to come off lease in July 2011.  In 
November 2010, Icon received appraisals that indicated that the fair market value of each of the 
two vessels, on a “charter free” basis (i.e. calculating fair market value in the absence of whatever 
income-generating lease was actually in place), was $9.86 million  at the time of the appraisal and 
$8 million  as of July 2011, when the current lease was to end.  These amounts were well below the 
carrying value of $31.2 million  for each vessel and, as such, were an indicator of impairment under 
GAAP.  Icon then conducted a recoverability analysis using  assumptions of future rental income 
that were based on the Hamburg Method and determined that the Mayon and the Samar did not 
need to be impaired.  However, Icon’s assumptions and methodology  were erroneous in at least 
two respects. 

       12.    First, Icon’s assumptions about future cash flow in conducting its recoverability 
analysis were based on the Hamburg Method’s ten-year historical average, which was inconsistent 
with future lease rates Icon anticipated it may actually be able to obtain for the two vessels in 2011.  
In conducting its recoverability analysis, Icon relied on the Hamburg Method’s ten-year historical 
average lease rate in assuming that it would be able to re-lease the Mayon and the Samar in July 
2011 for three years at a daily rate of $11,267  and used that rate in its future cash flow analysis.  
However, Icon’s own internal documentation and contemporaneous market communications  with 
third parties (from January 2011 through the filing  of the relevant Leasing Funds’ Forms 10-Ks in 
March 2011) regarding prevailing  lease rates and the remarketing of the vessels show that Icon 
expected that a $3,000/day lease rate for a three year lease was more likely  when the vessels came 
off lease in July 2011. 

       13.    Under these circumstances, GAAP required that future cash flow estimates used to 
test the recoverability of a long-term asset value incorporate the company’s own assumptions about 
its use of the asset, consider all available evidence, and be reasonable in relation to the cash flow 
assumptions used for other corporate purposes or for developing  information  communicated to 
other parties.  ASC 360-10-35-30. 

       14.    Second, Icon also did not account correctly for certain expenses in calculating 
projected cash flows using the Hamburg Method.  Icon typically  allowed for up to an additional  $2 
million  expense for any vessel that would require an expensive and lengthy form of mandatory 
periodic “dry dock” maintenance (i.e. when the vessel is not in service) known as a “special 
survey,” and which party (the lessor or the lessee) would bear responsibility  for such costs was 
factored into lease negotiations.  Both GAAP and the Hamburg Method require this expense to be 

                                                 5  
---------------------Page 6---------------------

included in future cash flow calculations,  where applicable.  However, Icon did not deduct this 
expense from its future cash flow calculations for the Mayon and the Samar even though both 
vessels were due for special surveys during the prospective lease period.  Reducing future cash 
flows – even using $11,267  per day figure as the starting point – by the amount of this expense 
alone would have caused both vessels to fail the recoverability test, requiring Icon to determine the 
fair value of the vessels and record an impairment charge if the fair value of the vessels was less 
than their carrying values.  In fact, in February 2011 – one month before the Forms 10-K were filed 
– Icon shipping  personnel involved  in the new lease negotiations for the two vessels realized that 
they had neglected to include the vessels’ special survey costs when estimating projected returns 
on the vessels.  The shipping  personnel corrected this error in their work, which lowered expected 
returns, and the projections they prepared for their work assumed a new lease rate consistent with 
then current market conditions  rather than the much higher $11,267 rate – sans special survey costs 
– that Icon accounting personnel used in the recoverability testing. 

        15.     Using the valuation  methodology  that Icon employed when impairing  the value of a 
different set of vessels in the prior year (discussed below at ¶¶ 25-29), the fair value of the Mayon 
and Samar vessels as of December 31, 2010 (the relevant measurement date) was approximately 
$13.3 million  each, or approximately  $18 million  below the carrying value of $31.2 million  per 
       3
vessel.    Accordingly, an impairment  charge of approximately  $18 million  each was required for 
the Mayon and   the  Samar as of December 31, 2010     , for a total of  $36 million.   By not recording 
the  $36 million  impairment  charge , Icon overstated the carrying value of the two vessels by that 
amount, resulting in  inaccuracies in reported  net income (loss) and members’ equity in the Forms 
10-K filed by Funds 9, 10 and 12 for the year ended December 31, 2010, which were filed in late 
             4
March 2011.     The  misstated 2010 year  - end financial results for Funds    9, 10 and 12 were also 
reported  in those Leasing   Funds’ Forms 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, which were 
filed in late March 2012. 

        Insufficient Impairment of the Vessels in the First Quarter of 2011 

        16.     In the quarter ended March 31, 2011, Icon did cause Funds 9, 10 and 12 to take an 
impairment  charge for the Mayon and the Samar, but the charge was insufficient under GAAP and 

                                               
3
        This method starts with the vessels’ appraised fair market value, which provides the 
vessels’ “charter-free” (i.e., unleased) value, and then adds to that number the net present (i.e. 
discounted) value of 100% of the existing lease rate through the end of the current lease to arrive at 
fair value.  Here, the $13.3 million  estimate of the fair value of the Mayon and the Samar vessels as 
of December 31, 2010 is the sum of the appraisal’s current fair market value of $9.86 million  and 
the net present value of 100% of the existing lease rate of $17,000 per day through July 23, 2011, 
the expiration date of the current lease.  The discount rate used for the net present value calculation 
of the remaining  lease payments was 5.48%, which is the same rate that Icon used when 
performing a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the Mayon and the Samar 
at March 31, 2011. 

4
        The   quantitative  impact of the accounting errors discussed herein on each of the relevant 
Leasing Fund  s’ financial  statements are presented below in paragraphs 34-37 for each affected 
reporting  period. 

                                                    6  
---------------------Page 7---------------------

resulted in each vessel’s recorded value still  being overstated by approximately $7.5 million,  which 
led to inaccuracies in the same three Leasing Funds’ Forms 10-Q for the first quarter of 2011, 
which were filed in mid-May 2011. 

        17.     In May 2011 (before the first quarter Forms 10-Q were filed), Icon signed a three-
year charter for both vessels that was to begin in July 2011 and that provided for $3,900 in daily 
rental income, consistent with the offers it had received a few months earlier.  Having now locked 
in a new lease rate far below the $11,267  average rate for the prior ten years, Icon conducted a cash 
flow analysis using the new lease rate and, as a result, the Mayon and the Samar both failed the 
recoverability test.  Icon recorded impairment  charges of approximately  $11 million  for each of the 
vessels, reducing their carrying values from $30 million  to approximately  $19 million.   However, 
these impairment charges were insufficient  under GAAP because Icon overestimated the vessels’ 
fair value by using the ten-year historical average lease rate derived under the Hamburg Method 
rather than relevant market data in selecting the measurement inputs and using a methodology  that 
excluded the relevant market data as inputs. 

        18.     Under GAAP, fair value accounting requires the maximum  utilization  of market 
                                                                     5
data and relevant, available market data cannot be disregarded.          In this instance, Icon had obtained 
appraisals of both vessels in November 2010, and these appraisals, which were based on recent 
sales of similar vessels, constituted relevant market data.  Comparable sales data are        generally 
considered to be  observable,   level 2    valuation inputs under GAAP.  In addition,  in March 2011, 
Icon had purchased two vessels similar to the Mayon and Samar, but two years n            ewer, for $13 
million  each .  As part of that transaction, Icon received appraisals valuing  those    newer   vessels at 
$13 - 15 million each, well above the   $9.86 mi  llion  appraised  value   of the older Mayon and Samar 
vessels in November 2010 but still     far  below the $31.2 million  values recorded for each of the 
older vessels on the  Leasing    Funds’ books as of December 31, 2010, just three months earlier. 

        19.     Nevertheless, when valuing  the Mayon and the Samar in May 2011, Icon did not 
use the observable inputs that it had available, in the form of recent, comparable sales transactions, 
as its inputs.  Icon incorrectly assumed that in light  of the market downturn discussed above, the 
vessel appraisals and the comparable sales relied on by the appraisers could be disregarded, and 
Icon did not conduct any analysis of the circumstances pertaining to the sales on which the 

                                               
5
        ASC 820   -10-35 -36  states that the methods    used to measure fair value “shall  maximize 
the use of relevant  observable inputs  and minimize  the use of unobservable inputs.”  ASC 820 
prioritizes  inputs used to measure fair value into three levels based on the observability  of the 
inputs.  The highest,  and generally  most reliable,  level of inputs  – Level 1 – are “quoted  prices 
(unadjusted)  in active markets for identical  assets or liabilities.”   ASC 820-10-35-40.   Level 2 
inputs are “inputs  other than quoted prices included  within  Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability,  either directly  or indirectly.”   ASC 820-10-35-47.   Level 3 inputs,  generally  the 
least reliable,  are “unobservable  inputs  for the asset or liability.”   ASC 820-10-35-52.   ASC 820-
10-35-53  further notes as follows:   “Unobservable inputs  shall be used to measure fair value to 
the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing  for situations  in 
which there is little,  if any market activity for the asset or liability  at the measurement date 
[emphasis added].”

appraisals relied.  Instead, as was known to the Leasing Funds’ outside auditors, Icon used an 
unobservable input in the form of an estimated “net charter” rate, calculated using the Hamburg 
Method’s ten-year historical average.  This method resulted in a projected $11,164 per-day rate for 
a prospective renewal lease assumed to begin in 2014.  The projected $11,164 daily rate was more 
than double the $3,900 per day to which Icon had just agreed in the new lease scheduled to begin 
in July 2011.  Icon’s use of this projected $11,164  rate for a prospective lease three years in the 
future without giving  weight to the contemporaneous, and observable, market data described above 
– the type of data that Icon itself had recently used in determining  similar vessels’ fair value – was 
an improper use of a “Level 3” valuation input because, as noted above, GAAP mandates that 
“[v]aluation  techniques used to measure fair value shall maximize  the use of observable inputs and 
minimize  the use of unobservable inputs.”  In addition,  Icon’s own internal contemporaneous 
documents and other evidence demonstrate that Icon lacked a reasonable basis for concluding  that 
it would have actually been able to sell either the Mayon or the Samar at that time at a price near 
the $19 million  calculated value figure yielded by its sole reliance on the “Level 3” inputs. 

       20.    Using the methodology  described above in footnote 3, which maximizes use of the 
observable market inputs available to Icon at the time by adding the net present value of 100% of 
the remaining lease payments due under the existing lease to the appraisal’s current fair market 
value of $9.86 million,  the fair value of the Mayon and the Samar vessels as of March 31, 2011 
was approximately $11.8 million  each.  This valuation results in an impairment  charge of $18.5 
million  per vessel, $7.5 million  higher than the $11 million  impairment charge taken by Icon for 
each vessel in the first quarter of 2011.  By not recording a total impairment  charge of $37 million, 
Icon overstated the carrying value of the two vessels by a total of approximately  $15 million, 
resulting in inaccuracies in reported net income (loss) and members’ equity in the Forms 10-Q for 
the quarter ended March 31, 2011 filed by Funds 9, 10 and 12.    The misstated first quarter 2011 
financial results for Funds 9, 10 and 12 were also reported in those Leasing Funds’ Forms 10-Q for 
the first quarter of 2012. 

Reversal of Reduction in Estimated Residual Values of Vessels Leased to Companies A and B 

       21.    An additional  accounting error involved  Icon’s failure to lower the residual values 
(which are an estimate of the sale or scrap values at the end of a vessel’s useful life) of eight 
vessels owned by Funds 9, 10, 11 and 12 and leased to two separate shipping companies 
(“Companies A and B”), resulting in inaccuracies on those Leasing Funds’ books and records and 
in their publicly  filed financial statements for interim and annual periods from 2010 through the 
end of 2011. 

       22.    In early 2010, Icon concluded that the residual values of the vessels leased to 
Companies A and B needed to be reduced and depreciation expense therefore needed to be 
increased.   Icon estimated that the residual value of the vessels to the four Leasing Funds had 
decreased by amounts ranging from approximately  $4.9 million  to $11.1 million  per vessel, for an 
aggregate reduction of $66.9 million.   However, after discussions with the Leasing Funds’ outside 
auditor, Icon reversed those reductions before filing  the Leasing Funds’ Forms 10-Q for the quarter 
ended March 31, 2010, and did not reinstate the reductions in any subsequent period, resulting in 
inaccuracies in each of the relevant periodic reports through the end of 2011.  Based on Icon’s own 
residual value analysis, the proposed reductions in residual values and corresponding  increases in 

                                                 8  
---------------------Page 9---------------------

depreciation were appropriate, and there was no reasonable basis for forgoing those adjustments 
from the first quarter of 2010 through the end of 2011. 

       23.    By the beginning  of 2010, charter (i.e., lease) rates had been depressed for some 
time and recent appraisals of vessels’ fair market value were coming in significantly  below their 
carrying values, including  appraisals for the vessels leased to Companies A and B, an indication 
under GAAP that the residual values may be too high and should be evaluated.  ASC 360-10-35-
22.  Consequently, Icon adjusted residual values for the vessels leased to Companies A and B on 
the four Leasing Funds’ books as of January 1, 2010 in the amounts set forth above.  The financial 
statement impact of these adjustments would  occur over time, as depreciation expense increased in 
order to depreciate the book value of the vessels to their new, lower residual value.  Icon recorded 
these increases in depreciation expense, as reflected in the trial balances and drafts of the Leasing 
Funds’ Forms 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, which Icon provided to the Leasing 
Funds’ outside auditor in connection with the quarterly review.  Contemporaneous Icon documents 
and communications  between Icon and the auditor indicate that Icon’s accounting personnel were 
confident in the accuracy of the new, reduced residual values.  However, after those 
communications  with the auditor and shortly before the Forms 10-Q were filed, Icon reversed the 
residual value and depreciation adjustments.  Neither Icon nor the auditor documented the reason 
or factual basis for this change or that there was even an expectation, at that time, that the residual 
values would recover. 

       24.    Icon’s reversal of the reduction in residual values and increase in depreciation 
expenses resulted in a number of inaccuracies in the four Leasing Funds’ financial statements and 
periodic reports, as the residual values were overstated in multiple  subsequent reporting periods as 
well.  The net income (loss) and members’ equity for all four Leasing Funds were misstated for 
each quarter of 2010 and for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to these residual value errors.  
The net income (loss) and members’ equity for Funds 10 and 12 were also misstated for the year 
ended December 31, 2011 and each interim period therein due to these residual value errors.  In 
addition,  the net income (loss) and members’ equity for Fund 11 was misstated for the first two 
quarters of 2011 due to these residual value errors.  These misstated financial results were also 
reported in each Leasing Fund’s subsequent corresponding periodic reports, as late as through year 
end 2012 for Funds 10 and 12.  

Insufficient Impairment of Vessels Leased to Company C 

       25.    A further accounting error involved  Icon’s failure to sufficiently impair the 
recorded value of four vessels owned by Fund 11 and leased to Company C (“Company C 
vessels”).  Icon made an error in its impairment  analysis that resulted in an overstatement of the 
value of the Company C vessels on Fund 11’s books and records and in inaccuracies in Fund 11’s 
publicly  filed financial statements for interim and annual periods from the third quarter of 2009 
through the end of 2010.   

       26.    As of September 30, 2009, Fund 11 was carrying the Company C vessels at a value 
of $81.1 million  on the Leasing Fund’s books.  In the third quarter of 2009, Company C was 
experiencing financial difficulties  and the parties renegotiated the four leases, resulting in lower 
lease payments to Fund 11.  Icon recognized this event as an indicator of impairment  under GAAP 

                                                 9  
---------------------Page 10---------------------

and further determined that Fund 11 needed to recognize an impairment  loss.  Ultimately,  Icon 
impaired the Company C vessels by approximately $35.1 million  and recorded their new carrying 
value at $46 million.   However, Icon made an error in calculating the estimated fair value of the 
vessels, which led to an insufficient impairment  and an overstatement of the recorded value for the 
Company C vessels. 

       27.    To estimate the Company C vessels’ fair value, Icon used the valuation method 
described above in paragraph 15 and used “Level 2” observable inputs from different sources.  
Icon had obtained independent appraisals of the Company C vessels’ fair market value as part of its 
review of their carrying values, and Icon used one of the appraiser’s fair market value estimates as 
an input in its valuation formula.  One appraisal estimated the current fair market value of the 
Company C vessels ($22.1 million),  and the other appraisal estimated their fair market value at the 
end of the existing lease term ($20.8 million),  both on a “charter free” basis (i.e. in the absence of 
whatever income-generating lease was actually in place).  To determine fair value, Icon added the 
appraiser’s current fair market value estimate to Icon’s own estimate of the net present value of the 
rental cash flows it was entitled to receive from Company C during the term of the renegotiated 
leases. 

       28.    However, Icon failed to correctly calculate the net present value of the cash flows 
from the leases.  Icon appropriately used the renegotiated lease rates and payment schedules and 
then meant to apply a discount rate of 8% to determine the net present value of those future 
payments.  Icon erred, however, by using an incorrect formula when discounting  cash flows in its 
present value calculation, resulting in an overstated present value estimate.  This flawed present 
value calculation,  recorded on the Leasing Fund’s books and records and in documents provided 
by Icon to the Leasing Fund’s auditor, resulted in a suggested impairment  of $33.4 million,  leading 
to a carrying value of $47.7 million.   For reasons unrelated to the fair value analysis,  Icon further 
impaired the vessels by another $1.7 million  to a carrying value of $46 million,  but despite this 
additional  impairment,  there was still an overstatement of the Company C vessels’ recorded value.  
Applying  the 8% discount rate used by Icon, a correct calculation of the sum of the net present 
value of the cash flows due over the course of the leases and the appraisal’s current fair market 
value results in a fair value of approximately  $43.1 million,  $2.9 million  less than the $46 million 
recorded by Icon.  The impairment  of the Company C vessels should therefore have been $2.9 
million  greater than what Icon recorded, or $38 million. 

       29.    By not recording the required $38 million  impairment  charge at that time or in 
subsequent reporting periods, Icon overstated the carrying value of the Company C vessels by $2.9 
million,  resulting in a number of inaccuracies in Fund 11’s financial statements and periodic 
reports.  Due to these impairment errors, Fund 11’s net income and members’ equity were 
misstated in financial statements in its Forms 10-K for both the year ended December 31, 2009, 
and the year ended December 31, 2010, as well as in financial statements in its Forms 10-Q for the 
third quarter of 2009 and the first three quarters of 2010.  These misstated financial results for 
Fund 11 were also reported in that Leasing Fund’s subsequent corresponding periodic reports 
through year end 2012.

---------------------Page 11---------------------

Non-Impairment of Auto Equipment Owned by Fund 11 

       30.    Icon also did not impair auto parts manufacturing equipment owned by Fund 11 
and leased to a French company (“Auto Equipment”) at the time required by GAAP.  Icon’s failure 
to impair the Auto Equipment resulted in an overstatement in the value of the Auto Equipment of 
approximately  $3.1 million,  which led to an overstatement of Fund 11’s assets and net income in 
its Forms 10-Q for the second and third quarters of 2010 and of 2011. 

       31.    In early 2009, the lessee of the Auto Equipment  declared bankruptcy and the Auto 
Equipment came under the jurisdiction  of a French bankruptcy court.  As a result, Icon recorded, as 
of December 31, 2009, an allowance for the past due balances owed by the lessee on the lease and 
disclosed that income from the lease would be recorded on a cash basis.  Nevertheless, Icon did not 
impair the Auto Equipment assets at that time, even though the decision to record an allowance and 
to record income on a cash basis – a clear indication  that Icon considered the collectability  of the 
future lease payments to be in doubt – indicates that Icon may have had difficulty  establishing  that 
future cash flows would have been sufficient to recover the asset’s value.  In fact, Icon did not 
perform a recoverability analysis at all because it mistakenly used an incorrect (lower) book value 
in its impairment  review.  That lower net book value led Icon to conclude incorrectly that the Auto 
Equipment assets’ estimated fair value was greater than the recorded book value and that therefore 
there was no indication  of impairment. 

       32.    In June 2010, Icon signed an agreement with the original  lessee and a new lessee 
transferring the Auto Equipment to the new lessee and amending the terms of the lease to provide 
for lower rental payments to Fund 11.  At that point, impairment  was required because the reduced 
lease rate resulted in future cash flows that were lower than the asset’s carrying value.  However, 
Icon still did not record an impairment charge at that time because, according to Icon, the Icon 
personnel who executed the new lease agreement failed to provide the lease to the relevant finance 
and valuation personnel until  February 2011. 

       33.    Icon eventually recorded an impairment  charge on the Auto Equipment for Fund 11 
in the amount of approximately  $3.1 million,  but not until the fourth quarter of 2010.  Icon’s failure 
to record the impairment charge by the second quarter of 2010 caused Fund 11’s books and records 
to overstate the carrying value of the Auto Equipment in the second and third quarters of 2010, 
resulting in inaccuracies in reported net income (loss) and members’ equity in Fund 11’s financial 
statements and interim periodic reports for the second and third quarters of 2010, including  for the 
nine months ended September 30, 2010.  These misstated financial results for Fund 11 were also 
reported in its Forms 10-Q for the second and third quarters of 2011. 

Impact of the Foregoing Errors on the Leasing Funds’ Financial Results 

       34.    Fund 9’s reported financial results were misstated for the relevant periods due to 
both Icon’s failure to lower the residual values of the vessels leased to Companies A and B (the 
“RV” error) and by Icon’s failure to properly impair the recorded value of the Mayon and Samar 
vessels (the “M/S” error), as follows:

Non-Disclosure of a Material Change in Estimate 

       38.    In the second quarter of 2009, Icon reduced its estimate of the residual value of four 
vessels leased by Fund 11 to Company D but failed to disclose that change in Fund 11’s 
subsequent periodic reports, as required by GAAP.  This change in estimate did not have a material 
impact on Fund 11’s financial statement results for the second quarter of 2009, but it was expected 
to, and did, have a material impact on Fund 11’s reported results in future periods and, under 
GAAP, was therefore required to be disclosed. 

       39.    In Fund 11’s Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2009 (and subsequent periodic 
reports), Icon disclosed that Company D had terminated its lease for the four vessels on June 24, 
2009, approximately two years before the end of the lease term.  While Icon did not impair those 
vessels at that time, Icon reduced the residual value of the vessels by $14 million  on Fund 11’s 
books and records.  Going forward, Icon projected an increase in depreciation expense of 
approximately  $5.6 million  per quarter as a result of this reduction in the estimated residual value 
of the vessels.  Because this change in estimate was not disclosed in Fund 11’s Form 10-Q for the 
second quarter or in subsequent periodic reports, Fund 11’s financial statements for the quarter and 
nine months ended September 30, 2009, and the year ended December 31, 2009 did not comply 
with GAAP, which requires disclosure of changes that are expected to materially impact future 
quarters.  ASC 250-10-50-4.   

       40.    The additional  $5.6 million  in depreciation expense represented approximately 
10.5% of the net loss for the quarter, and 23.5% for the nine months, ended September 30, 2009.  
The total increase in depreciation expense due to the reduction in residual value was approximately 
$11.2 million  for the year ended December 31, 2009, which was approximately 25.5% of the loss 
reported for 2009 and 8% of members’ equity.  The disclosure  was also required to have been 
included in Fund 11’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, as that periodic report 
reiterated the financial statements at issue. 

       41.    The reduction in the residual value estimate and the resulting impact on Fund 11’s 
financial results was particularly relevant because residual values were a key component of the 
Leasing Funds’ business model.  The Leasing Funds’ ability  to achieve their anticipated rates of 
investment return depended in large part on Icon’s ability  to realize their assets’ value at the end of 
the leases, and the possible inability  to realize the estimated residual asset values was identified  as 
a risk factor in the Leasing Funds’ Forms 10-K.

Inaccurate Disclosure of the Methodology for Calculating ERISA Valuation 

       42.    In addition,  Icon failed to accurately disclose in multiple  Forms 10-K for Funds 9, 
10, 11 and 12 the methodology  used to calculate the estimated value of Leasing Fund interests for 
ERISA reporting purposes.  Under applicable rules, the Leasing Funds were required to calculate 
and report the estimated value of their member interests for ERISA purposes in the event that the 
Leasing Fund “assets were sold in an orderly liquidation  as of the close of [the] fiscal year and all 
proceeds from such sales, without reduction for transaction costs and expenses, together with any 
cash held by [the Leasing Fund], were distributed to the members upon liquidation.” 

       43.    Until 2014, the relevant annual reports stated that this value was calculated as 
follows:   

       [W]e calculated the sum of:  (i) the unpaid finance lease and note receivable payments on 
       our existing finance leases and notes receivable, discounted at the implicit  yield for each 
       such transaction; (ii) the fair market value of our operating leases, equipment held for sale 
       or lease, and other assets, as determined by the most recent third-party appraisals we have 
       obtained for certain assets or our Manager’s estimated values of certain other assets, as 
       applicable; and (iii) our cash on hand.  From this amount, we then subtracted our total debt 
       outstanding and then divided  the difference by the total number of Shares outstanding 
       [emphasis added]. 

       44.    However, Icon did not disclose in the annual reports that to determine the “fair 
market value” of assets for these purposes, Icon used the greater of net book value or fair market 
value when impairment  was not taken.  For example, in the 2010 Forms 10-K for Funds 9, 10, 11 
and 12, Icon’s ERISA methodology  resulted in Icon using the $31 million  net book value of the 
Mayon as its “fair market value” for purposes of the ERISA calculation,  which was substantially 
below the vessel’s appraised and fair values for the reasons discussed above in paragraphs 11-15. 

       45.    Icon subsequently corrected this omission  and, beginning  with the year ended 
December 31, 2013, changed the disclosure in the Leasing Funds’ Forms 10-K to expressly state 
that the “greater of net book value or fair market value” was used in the ERISA calculation. 

                                         VIOLATIONS 

       46.    By reason of the foregoing,  Icon was a cause of the relevant Leasing Funds’ 
violations  of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 
Rule 13a-13 and 12b-20 thereunder.  As described above, Funds 9, 10, 11 and 12 filed annual and 
quarterly reports that included financial statements that were not prepared in accordance with 
GAAP, as required by Regulation  S-X.  Those Leasing Funds also violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) by 
not keeping accurate books and records, and violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) by not devising  and 
maintaining  a sufficient system of internal accounting controls.  As the entity that performed and 
was responsible for the Leasing Funds’ accounting functions, including  their recordkeeping and 
internal control functions, and for the preparation of the Leasing Funds’ financial statements and 
periodic reports, Icon caused the Leasing Funds’ violations  of these financial reporting, 
recordkeeping and internal control provisions.

                                               IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission  deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondent Icon’s Offer. 

       Accordingly,  it is hereby ORDERED that: 

       A.     Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Icon cease and desist 
from committing  or causing any violations  and any future violations  of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  

       B.     Respondent shall pay a civil money penalty of $750,000  to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission  for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to 
Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3).  Payment shall be made in installments  according to the

             An additional payment of $85,000 due within 90 days after the entry of this Order. 
             An additional payment of $85,000 due within 180 days after the entry of this Order. 
             An additional payment of $85,000 due within 270 days after the entry of this Order. 
             An additional payment of $85,000 due within 360 days after the entry of this Order. 
             An additional payment of $85,000 due within 450 days after the entry of this Order.

             An additional payment of $90,000 due within 630 days after the entry of this Order. 

       C.     If any payment is not made by the date the payment is required by this Order, the 
entire outstanding balance of civil penalties, plus any additional  interest accrued pursuant to 31 
U.S.C. § 3717, shall be due and payable immediately,  without further application. 

       D.     Payment must be made in one of the following  ways:   

               (1)    Respondent may transmit payment electronically  to the Commission,  which 
                      will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;  

               (2)    Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov 
                      through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or  

               (3)     Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United 
                      States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange 
                      Commission  and hand-delivered or mailed to:

       E.     Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter 
identifying  Icon as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a 
copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Sanjay Wadhwa, Division  of 
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission,  New York Regional Office, 200 Vesey Street, 
Suite 400, New York, New York 10281. 

       F.     Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be 
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including  all tax purposes.  To 
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil  penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor 
Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any 
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil 
penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset").  If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a 
Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within  30 days after entry of a final order granting 
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the 
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Such a payment shall not be deemed 
an additional  civil  penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil  penalty 
imposed in this proceeding.  For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a 
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based 
on substantially  the same facts as alleged in the Order issued by the Commission  in this 
proceeding. 

       By the Commission.
