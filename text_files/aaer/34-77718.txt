A.      RESPONDENTS 
 
  
        1.      David S. Hall, P.C. d/b/a/ The Hall Group CPAs is a Texas corporation 
which was licensed to practice public accountancy in Texas as The Hall Group CPAs from 
                                                                                   3
April 5, 2006 through May 31, 2014.  Thakkar CPA, PLLC (“Thakkar CPA”)  acquired 
certain assets of David S. Hall, P.C. on or about January 6, 2014 (the “Closing Date”), after 
which the latter firm ceased operations.  Thakkar CPA agreed to pay David S. Hall, P.C. 
$450,000 in cash at closing and to enter into a 5%, two-year promissory note for $313,516.  
On March 25, 2015, David S. Hall, P.C. requested that its registration with the PCAOB be 
withdrawn. 
         
        2.      David S. Hall, age 58 and a resident of Lewisville, Texas, is a CPA 
licensed in Texas.  Hall owns 100% of David S. Hall, P.C.  On April 15, 2014, Hall 
became the CFO for DynaResource, Inc., (“DynaResource”) whose auditor was David S. 
Hall, P.C. d/b/a The Hall Group CPAs through January 29, 2014 and, later, Thakkar CPA 
d/b/a The Hall Group CPAs for the 2013 audit and 2014 reviews. 
         
        3.      Michelle L. Helterbran Cochran, age 46 and a resident of Coppell, Texas, 
is a CPA licensed in the state of Texas.  From September 2007 through July 2013, 
Helterbran was employed by David S. Hall, P.C. and became a non-equity partner with that 
firm in February 2012.   
         
        4.      Susan A. Cisneros, age 58 and a resident of Flower Mound, Texas, holds a 
Master’s of Science degree in Accounting from the University of North Texas but is not a 
CPA.  Cisneros worked as an audit senior for David S. Hall, P.C. from January 2005 
through January 2012 and again from May 2013 through December 2013.   
 

                                                                                                                                                 
The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before 
it . . . to any person who is found . . . to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation 
of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 
3
 On  April 6  , 2016  , the Commission issued an Order finding that  Thakkar CPA, its managing partner, and 
its owner  , engaged in improper professional conduct and violated or willfully violated Rule 2-02 of 
Regulation S-X and caused issuers to violation Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 
13a -13 thereunder.  The Order also found that Thakkar CPA’s Vice President of Operations caused 
Thakkar CPA’s violations of Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X and  caused issuers to violate Section 13(a) 
of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  In the Matter of Thakkar CPA, PLLC et. al, 
Exchange Act Rel. No. 77542 (April 6, 2016).

B.     OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES 
 
       5.      Thakkar CPA, is a Texas corporation formed to acquire certain assets of 
David S. Hall, P.C. and provided auditing services for multiple public companies between 
January 2014 and January 2015 signing audit reports as “The Hall Group CPAs,” but never 
became registered with the PCAOB. 
        
C.     FACTS 
        
      i.    Failure to Conduct Audits and Reviews in Accordance with PCAOB 
           Standards 
            
       6.      The Hall Group, Hall, Helterbran, and Cisneros collectively failed to 
                                                          4
conduct at least 16 annual audits and 35 quarterly reviews  in accordance with PCAOB 
standards in at least three  ways: (1) they  repeatedly failed to prepare adequate audit 
documentation in connection wi  th audit and review engagement  s; (2)  failed to   conduct – or 
failed to obtain – an engagement quality review (“EQR”) of audit and review engagements 
by a qualified reviewer; and (3) on at least four engagements, The Hall Group and Hall 
performed audit services while the firm’s independence was impaired.  As a result, The 
Hall Group falsely stated that it conducted its audits in accordance with PCAOB standards 
in at least 16 annual audit reports for eight issuers.  Additionally, Hall, after becoming CFO 
of DynaResource, Inc., allowed Thakkar CPA to provide audit services to DynaResource, 
Inc. even though he knew he had a direct financial interest in and a business relationship 
with the company’s external audit firm. 
        
               a.  Failure to Adequately Prepare Required Audit Documentation 
                    
       7.      PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 3, Audit Documentation (“AS 3”), states 
that “[a]udit documentation is the written record of the basis for the auditor’s conclusions 
that provides the support for the auditor’s representations, whether those representations are 
contained in the auditor’s report or otherwise.”  (emphasis in original.)  AS 3, ¶ 2.  
Additionally, AS 3 states that: 
        
       The auditor must document the procedures performed, evidence obtained, 
       and  conclusions  reached  with  respect  to  relevant  financial  statement 
       assertions.  Audit documentation must clearly demonstrate that the work 
       was  in  fact  performed.   This  documentation  requirement  applies  to  the 
       work of all those who participate in the engagement as well as to the work 
       of specialists the auditor uses as evidential matter in evaluating relevant 
       financial   statement    assertions.   Audit    documentation   must   contain 
       sufficient   information   to   enable   an   experienced   auditor,   having   no 
       previous connection with the engagement:

       See Appendix attached herewith. 

                                             3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

 

           a.  To  understand  the  nature,  timing,   extent,  and  results   of  the 
               procedures    performed,    evidence    obtained,    and    conclusions 
               reached, and  

           b.  To determine who performed the work and the date such work was 
               completed as well as the person who reviewed the work and the 
               date of such review. (emphasis added) AS 3, ¶ 6 

       8.      AS 3 states that an auditor must “identify all significant findings or issues in 
an engagement completion document,” which includes either all information necessary to 
understand the significant findings, issues or provides references to other audit 
documentation.  AS 3, ¶ 13 (emphasis in original.) 
        
       9.      The Hall Group utilized standardized forms and checklists while 
documenting its audit work.  For example, The Hall Group used a “Supervision, Review 
and Approval Form” to document, in part, (1) who performed the partner review and the 
engagement quality review, (2) the dates of such reviews, (3) the partner’s approval for 
issuance of the report, and (4) the engagement quality reviewer’s concurring approval for 
issuance of the report.  The Hall Group also used a standardized “Engagement Completion 
Document Form” to assist in summarizing all significant findings or issues.   
        
       10.    Hall and Helterbran failed to comply with AS 3 on multiple audits because 
their workpapers contained blank or incomplete Supervision, Review, and Approval Forms 
and blank or incomplete Engagement Completion Document Forms for at least five audit 
and twenty review engagements over multiple periods.   
        
       11.    The existence of blank or incomplete Engagement Completion Document 
Forms further evidences Hall’s and Helterbran’s failure to prepare documentation in 
accordance with AS 3 requirements and does not allow an experienced auditor, having no 
previous connection with the engagement, to determine who reviewed the work and the 
date of such review.   
 
               b.  Failure to Obtain Required Engagement Quality Reviews 
                    
       12.    Auditing Standard No. 7, Engagement Quality Review (“AS 7”), requires an 
auditor to obtain an EQR and concurring approval to issue the engagement report for each 
                                     5
audit and interim review engagement.     Additionally, AS 7  states, “[a]n engagement quality 
reviewer from the firm that issues the engagement report (or communicates an engagement 
conclusion, if no report is issued) must be a partner or another individual in an equivalent 
position.”  Among other things, an engagement quality reviewer must be competent, i.e., 
must possess the level of knowledge and competence related to accounting, auditing and 
financial reporting required to serve as the engagement partner on the engagement under 
review.  Additionally, an engagement quality reviewer must have competence, 
independence, integrity, and objectivity.  To maintain objectivity, the engagement quality 
                                                 
5
       AS 7 is effective for audits and interim reviews for fiscal years beginning on or after 
December 15, 2009. 
 

                                             4

reviewer should not make decisions on behalf of the engagement team or assume any of the 
responsibilities of the engagement team.  AS 7, ¶¶ 3-7. An audit firm may grant permission 
to the client to use the firm’s audit report only after the engagement quality reviewer 
provides concurring approval of issuance, AS 7, ¶ 13. 
        
       13.    The PCAOB defines the engagement partner as the member of the 
engagement team with primary responsibility for the audit.  Auditing Standard No. 10, 
Supervision of the Audit Engagement, (“AS 10”), Appendix, A2.  The engagement partner 
remains responsible for the engagement and its performance, notwithstanding the 
involvement of the engagement quality reviewer.  AS 7, ¶7.  Accordingly, the engagement 
partner is responsible for, among other things, compliance with PCAOB standards.  AS 10, 
¶3. 
        
       14.    Audit firms’ quality control policies and procedures should include 
provisions that provide the firm with reasonable assurance that the engagement quality 
reviewer has sufficient competence, among other things, to perform the EQR in accordance 
with PCAOB standards.  AS 7, ¶4.  Policies and procedures should be established to 
provide the firm with reasonable assurance that “those hired possess the appropriate 
characteristics to enable them to perform competently” and “[w]ork is assigned to 
personnel having the degree of technical training and proficiency required in the 
circumstances.”  PCAOB Quality Control Standard QC Section 40, The Personnel 
Management Element of a Firm's System of Quality Control-Competencies Required by a 
Practitioner-in-Charge of an Attest Engagement, ¶ 02. 
        
       15.    Hall and The Hall Group failed to establish these required policies and 
procedures.  Moreover, on multiple occasions, Hall and Helterbran also failed to comply 
with AS 7 by either failing to obtain any EQR or instructing an unqualified person, 
including Cisneros, to perform engagement quality reviews for multiple audit and review 
engagements from 2010 through 2013.  For at least two audit engagements, Hall 
improperly acted as both the engagement partner and the EQR partner. 
        
       16.    Hall and Helterbran knowingly or at least recklessly directed or permitted 
Cisneros to perform an EQR on multiple audits and reviews despite knowing she was not a 
                                             6
partner or someone in an equivalent position.    Cisneros knowingly or at least recklessly 
provided the engagement quality reviewer  ’s concurring approval of issuance of the report 
despite knowing that she was not a partner or someone in an equivalent position at The 
Hall Group and not qualified to conduct an EQR.  Indeed, Cisneros acknowledged to 
Commission staff that she lacked the knowledge and competence in accounting, auditing, 
and financial reporting required to serve as engagement partner for an engagement 
conducted under PCAOB standards. 
        

                                                 
6
       Although AS 7 does not necessarily require that persons performing EQRs be licensed CPAs, the 
standard states that the person “must be a partner or another individual in an equivalent position.”  Cisneros 
not being a CPA is relevant here because The Hall Group required anyone holding the title of 
“Principal/Partner” must also be a licensed CPA in Texas. 
 

                                             5 
---------------------Page 6---------------------

 

       17.    Cisneros performed the engagement quality reviews for at least eight issuer 
audit engagements for seven issuers and 15 reviews of six issuers’ interim financial 
information, and signed Supervision, Review, and Approval Forms, as the engagement 
quality reviewer.  In each instance, Hall and Helterbran failed to determine whether 
Cisneros prepared required documentation in connection with the EQRs she performed.  
AS 7, ¶¶ 9-11 and ¶ 21.   
        
       18.    Hall failed to comply with AS 7 even after confirming to the PCAOB that 
he would do so.  In connection the PCAOB’s 2013 inspection of The Hall Group, Hall 
confirmed in writing to the PCAOB inspection team that Cisneros performed the EQR for 
two issuers’ fiscal year 2012 audits and the EQRs for the first, second, and third quarter 
                          7
reviews for a third issuer.   Hall also told the inspection team during its fieldwork that 
Cisneros was not a CPA.    In August 2013, the PCAOB issued an     inspection comment 
stating that The Hall Group failed to comply with AS 7 and failed to ensure that EQRs 
were performed by persons with sufficient qualifications.  The inspection comment states 
that Hall’s representations demonstrated that Cisneros did not meet the firm’s requirements 
for a “Principal/Partner,” and, accordingly, she did not meet the AS 7 requirements for 
serving as EQR.  In an August 5, 2013 handwritten response to this inspection comment 
form, Hall wrote, “[w]e agree with the issue noted above and are in the process for [sic] 
negotiating with an outside firm (PCAOB registered) and will not issue any more reports 
until this is in place and have that firm perform the appropriate review process.” (emphasis 
added). 
        
       19.    Contrary to Hall’s representation, he knowingly disregarded the PCAOB 
standards when he failed to obtain an EQR by a qualified reviewer for any of the firm’s 
review and audit engagements for fiscal periods ended June 30 and September 30, 2013 – 
engagements conducted after his written representation to the PCAOB.  On at least one 
2013 audit, Hall added a memo to the audit file stating, in part, “The Hall Group did not 
have access to an Engagement Quality Reviewer for this audit” and “[t]herefore, Mr. Hall 
acted as Eng. Quality Reviewer.”  Hall then signed the supervision, review, and approval 
checklist as both the engagement and EQR partner.  Subsequently, for the first quarter 
fiscal year 2014 review for this same client, Hall did not sign off as EQR but added a 
memo to the file reiterating that “The Hall Group did not have access to an Engagement 
Quality Reviewer” and concluded by stating “[w]e stand by our work.” 
                    
               c.  The Hall Group’s Independence Was Impaired 
                    
       20.    Section 10A(j) of the Exchange Act, Audit Partner Rotation, states “it shall 
be unlawful for a registered public accounting firm to provide audit services to an issuer if 
the lead (or coordinating) audit partner (having primary responsibility for the audit) or the 
partner responsible for reviewing the audit, has performed audit services for that issuer in 
each of the previous five fiscal years of that issuer.   The Commission’s independence rules 
allow engagement and concurring partners to serve for five consecutive years, after which 
they may not serve in either role for another period of five years.  Rule 2-01(c)(6)(i)(A) of 

                                                 
7
       Freestone Resources, Inc. for fiscal year ended June 30, 2012; Seven Arts Entertainment for fiscal 
year ended June 30, 2012; and DynaResource for quarters ended March 31, June 30, and Sept. 30, 2012. 

                                               6 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

 

Regulation S-X.   Related PCAOB rules and standards require that a registered public 
accounting firm and its associated persons be independent of the Firm’s issuer audit clients.   
                    
       21.    Hall was The Hall Group’s sole partner prior to 2012 and therefore served 
as the only engagement partner on each of The Hall Group’s engagements before 2012.  In 
a February 2012 response to the PCAOB addressing deficiencies noted in the PCAOB’s 
2010 inspection, Hall acknowledged that he served as the lead engagement partner for one 
issuer for five consecutive years and the firm’s review of the issuer’s first quarter of the 
sixth year.  Hall explained that it was the last quarter the firm was engaged as the issuer’s 
auditor, and that to remediate, he (1) named Helterbran as a partner in February 2012; and 
(2) developed a log to ensure that appropriate partner rotation occurs.  
        
       22.    After Helterbran’s departure in early July 2013, Hall was once again The 
Hall Group’s sole partner.  Hall attempted to address the partner rotation issue by offering 
to promote one of his audit staff to a non-equity partner but the individual rejected the 
offer.  As a result, Hall knowingly or at least recklessly served as the lead engagement 
partner for at least three of The Hall Group’s reviews for quarters ended June 30, 2013 and 
September 30, 2013, even though he had already served as the lead engagement partner for 
five consecutive years and, accordingly, The Hall Group lacked independence under the 
Commission’s rules with respect to these issuers. 
                    
               d.  Reports on Audited Financial Statements 
                    
       23.    Under AU § 508, Reports on Audited Financial Statements, an auditor may 
only express an unqualified opinion on historical financial statements when he has formed 
such an opinion on the basis of an audit performed in accordance with PCAOB standards.  
AU § 508.07. 
        
       24.    Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X requires an accountant’s report to state 
“whether the audit was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.”  
And “references in Commission rules and staff guidance and in the federal securities laws 
to GAAS or to specific standards under GAAS, as they relate to issuers, should be 
understood to mean the standards of the PCAOB plus any applicable rules of the 
Commission.”  See SEC Release No. 34-49708 (May 14, 2004).  Thus, an auditor violates 
Regulation S-X Rule 2-02(b)(1) if it issues a report stating it has conducted its audit in 
accordance with PCAOB standards when it has not.   
        
.  
       25.    The Hall Group issued and Hall and Helterbran approved the issuance of, at 
least 16 audit reports, including at least eight for which Cisneros provided concurring 
approval of issuance.  Each of the firm’s audit reports states that “The Hall Group CPAs” 
conducted its audits in accordance with PCAOB standards.  As stated above, these 
statements were false.  As a result, The Hall Group willfully violated, and Hall, Helterbran, 
and Cisneros willfully aided and abetted The Hall Group’s violations of, Rule 2-02(b)(1).

     ii.    Hall, as CFO, Allowed DynaResource to File its 2014 Forms 10-Q Without 
           Reviews by an Independent Public Accountant 
            
       26.    Rule 10-01(d) of Regulation S-X states, in part, “[p]rior to filing, interim 
financial statements included in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (17 CFR 249.308(a)) must 
be reviewed by an independent public accountant using professional standards and 
procedures for conducting such reviews.”  Rules 2-01(c)(1) and 2-01(c)(3) of Regulation S-
X state, in part, that an accountant is not independent when the accounting firm has any 
loan to or from, or certain business relationships with, an audit client’s officers.   
        
       27.    After selling certain of his firm’s assets to Thakkar CPA, Hall assisted 
Thakkar CPA in soliciting audit engagements from each of The Hall Group’s audit clients, 
including DynaResource.  DynaResource engaged Thakkar CPA in January 2014.  On 
April 15, 2014, Thakkar CPA issued an audit report on DynaResource’s 2013 financial 
statements, which it signed as “The Hall Group CPAs.”  The same day, DynaResource 
named Hall as its CFO.  Thereafter, Hall functioned as Thakkar CPA’s primary contact on 
audit-related issues.  Thakkar CPA continued as DynaResource’s external auditor until it 
resigned on March 5, 2015. 
        
       28.    DynaResource filed its first, second, and third quarter 2014 Forms 10-Q 
with the Commission after the included financial statements were reviewed by Thakkar 
CPA.  Hall signed management letters of representation in connection with each of 
Thakkar CPA’s reviews, and made certifications required under Rule 13a-14 of the 
Exchange Act for each of DynaResource’s first, second, and third quarter 2014 Forms 
10-Q. 
        
       29.    Hall allowed Thakkar CPA to provide audit services to DynaResource even 
though he knew that he was an officer of the company and that he had a direct financial 
interest in and a business relationship with Thakkar, CPA.  Specifically, the following 
events impaired Thakkar CPA’s independence with respect to its reviews of interim 
financial information DynaResource included in its Forms 10-Q filed with the Commission 
in 2014:   
        
     Thakkar CPA delivered a note payable to David S. Hall, P.C., which remained 
       outstanding even after Hall became DynaResource’s CFO, as a result of the terms 
       of the asset purchase agreement, under which Thakkar paid Hall $450,000 in cash 
       and undertook a 5%, two-year promissory note for $313,516.  The final purchase 
       price also was dependent upon the future success of Thakkar CPA as the purchase 
       price was to be adjusted up or down based upon actual collection during the three 
       years following the Closing Date.  Additionally, the asset purchase agreement 
       included a provision under which Hall could earn fees for providing services to 
       Thakkar CPA after the Closing Date (although Hall did not earn any fees under 
       this provision). 
    

                                            8 
---------------------Page 9---------------------

 

     Thakkar CPA unilaterally suspended payments on the promissory note to David 
       S. Hall, P.C. in May 2014 after determining that future collections were likely to 
       be less than the amounts expected at the Closing Date.   

       30.    Hall allowed Thakkar CPA to provide audit services to DynaResource even 
though he knew he had a direct financial interest in and a business relationship with the 
company’s audit firm and, despite this knowledge, executed the certifications required 
under Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act and allowed DynaResource to file its 2014 Forms 
10-Q with the Commission. 
        
D.     VIOLATIONS 
 
       31.    As a result of the conduct described above, The Hall Group willfully 
violated, and Hall willfully aided and abetted and caused The Hall Group’s violations of, 
Section 10A(j), which makes it unlawful for a registered public accounting firm to provide 
audit services to an issuer if the lead (or coordinating) audit partner (having primary 
responsibility for the audit) or the partner responsible for reviewing the audit, has 
performed audit services for that issuer in each of the previous five fiscal years of that 
issuer.   
        
       32.    As a result of the conduct described above, The Hall Group willfully 
violated, and Hall, Helterbran, and Cisneros willfully aided and abetted and caused The 
Hall Group’s violations of, Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X which requires an 
accountant’s report to state whether the audit was made in accordance with PCAOB 
Standards. 
        
       33.    As a result of the conduct described above, The Hall Group, Hall, 
Helterbran, and Cisneros willfully aided and abetted and caused issuers to violate Section 
13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. 
        
       34.    As a result of the conduct described above, Hall willfully aided and abetted 
and caused DynaResource to violate Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-13 
thereunder. 
        
       35.    As a result of the conduct described above, Hall willfully violated rule 
13a-14 of the Exchange Act which requires an issuer’s principal financial officer to attest 
that the company’s “report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact.” 
 
       36.    As a result of the conduct described above, The Hall Group, Hall and 
Helterbran engaged in improper professional conduct subject to Section 4C(a)(2) of the 
Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice 102(e)(1)(ii). 
        
       37.    As a result of the conduct described above, Cisneros engaged in improper 
professional conduct subject to Section 4C(a)(2) of the Exchange Act. 
        
       38.    As a result of the conduct described above, The Hall Group, Hall, 
Helterbran, and Cisneros willfully violated and/or willfully aided and abetted and caused

violations of the federal securities laws, which constitutes conduct subject to Section 
4C(a)(3) of the Exchange Act the Commission’s Rules of Practice 102(e)(1)(iii). 
  
                                            III. 
        
       In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission 
deems it necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative and 
cease-and-desist proceedings be instituted to determine: 
        
       A.      Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in 
connection therewith, to afford Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses to such 
allegations;  
        
       B.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondents should 
be ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future 
violation of Sections 10A and 13(a) and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, 13a-14 of the Exchange Act 
and Rule 2-02(b)(1) of Regulation S-X; 
        
       C.      Whether, pursuant to Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e) of 
the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Respondents should be censured or denied, 
temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission 
as accountants; 
        
       D.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21B of the Exchange Act, civil penalties 
should be levied against Respondents; and 
        
       E.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21C(e) of the Exchange Act, Respondents 
should be subject to disgorgement with prejudgment interest. 
        
                                            IV. 
        
       IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the 
questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened not earlier than 30 days and not 
later than 60 days from service of this Order at a time and place to be fixed, and before an 
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the 
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.   
        
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each Respondent shall file an Answer to the 
allegations contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as 
provided by Rule 220 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.  
        
       If a Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after 
being duly notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be 
determined against him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be 
deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's 
Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.  §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.

       This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondents as provided for in the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice.    
        
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an 
initial decision no later than 300 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to 
Rule 360(a)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.  
        
       In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission 
engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually 
related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, 
except as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice.  Since this proceeding is 
not “rule making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it 
is not deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any 
final Commission action.
