File No. 3-17583 
 
SEC Charges Pennsylvania Bank and Current       and Former Officers With Accounting 
Violations Involving Impaired Loans 
 
September 27, 2016  The Securities  and Exchange Commission today  announced that 
Orrstown Financial Services, Inc., a Shippensburg, Pennsylvania-based bank holding company, 
its CEO, and two of its former senior officers have agreed to settle charges that Orrstown under-
reported its impaired loans in its SEC filings during 2010 and 2011 by as much as $69.5 million. 
 
An SEC investigation found that Orrstown, through its current CEO, Thomas R. Quinn, Jr., 
former CFO, Bradley S. Everly, and former Chief Credit Officer, Jeffrey W. Embly, repeatedly 
failed to accurately disclose the value of its impaired loans  as required by generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) in 2010 and 2011.  M any of those loans were made to some of 
the banks largest commercial real estate borrowers who were experiencing difficulty servicing 
their debt due to the declining economic environment  at the time.   The investigation also found 
that Orrstowns Chief Accounting Officer, D ouglas P. Barton incorrectly implemented a newly 
issued GAAP standard on troubled debt restructurings and did not calculate  the banks  loan  
losses in accordance with GAAP .  In addition, the SECs investigation found that Quinn, Everly, 
and Embly incorrectly applied Orrstowns loan policy and GAAP when calculating fair value for 
collateral in connection with impairment analyses related to certain commercial real estate loans. 
 
The SECs order finds that Orrstown, Quinn, Everly and Embly violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 
(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, that Orrstown violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, that Quinn, 
Everly and Embly violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and caused Orrstowns violations of 
Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 
thereunder, that Quinn and Everly violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, and that Barton violated 
Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and caused Orrstowns violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder .   
 
Without admit ting or deny ing the findings  in the SECs order , Orrstown, Quinn, Everly , Embly  
and Barton each agreed to the entry of a cease-and-desist order, Orrstown agreed to pay a civil 
penalty of $1 million, Quinn, Everly and Embly each agreed to pay a penalty of $100,000, and 
Barton agreed to pay a penalty of $25,000.  In addition, Everly agreed to be suspended from 
appearing and practicing before the SEC as an accountant, which includes not participating in the 
financial reporting or audits of public companies.  The SECs order permits Everly to apply for 
reinstatement after three years. 
 
The SECs investigation was conducted by Han Nguyen, Brian R. Higgins   , Jennifer Miller, Julia 
Green and Kingdon Kase of the Philadelphia Office , with assistance from Peter Rosario  in the 
SECs Washington, D.C. Office.  The matter was  supervised by G. Jeffrey Boujoukos .
