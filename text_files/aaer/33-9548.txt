proceedings, which are admitted, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-
and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21C of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, Imposing Civil Penalties and a Cease-and-

                                               III. 
 
       On the basis of this Order and Respondents  Offers, the Commission finds 1
                                                                                   that:  
 
                                          SUMMARY 

       1.      This matter involves disclosure and internal controls failures relating to valuation, 
related party transactions, and executive compensation by four non-traded real estate investment 
trusts (REITs)  AR6, AR7, AR8, AR9 (collectively the   Apple REITs)  their respective 
advisers, their Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairman of the Boards of Directors, Glade 
M. Knight (Knight), and their Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Bryan F. Peery (Peery).   

       2.      AR6, AR7, and AR8 made material misrepresentations and omissions concerning 
the valuation of their units in their Form S-3 dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) registration 
statements and in certain Forms 10-K.  The Apple REITs each   initially sold units  in blind pool 
offerings at, according to public disclosures, an arbitrarily established offering price of $11.00 per 
unit.  After the close of the initial offerings, each of the Apple REITs instituted a DRIP program 
wherein existing unitholders could reinvest their distributions in lieu of receiving cash.  Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) rules require that REITs sell their DRIP units at a reasonably accurate 
fair market value so that unitholders reinvesting dividends receive equivalent value to the cash 
dividend.  In an effort to comply with the IRS framework, the Apple REITs, in language drafted by 
outside counsel, represented to unitholders in the DRIP registration statements that the DRIP unit 
price [would] be based on the fair market value of [the REITs] units as of the reinvestment date 
as determined in good faith by [their] board[s] of directors from time to time.  Although the 
Forms S-3 disclosed that the per unit price for the plan will be determined at all times based on 
the most recent price at which an unrelated person has purchased our units, the Forms S-3 failed 
to disclose that the $11.00 unit price was not based on an appraisal of the Apple REITs assets or 
other valuation methodology.  The Forms S-3 also failed to disclose that, in contrast to an actively 
traded market, the price last paid for a DRIP share by an unrelated person in the context of a non-
traded REIT did not reflect a meaningful estimate of the underlying or realizable value of the units.   
Relying in part on DRIP sales and redemptions at $11.00, the Apple REITs also represented in 

                                                 
1
 The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents Offers and are not binding on any other person or 
entity in this or any other proceeding.   
                                                2  
---------------------Page 3---------------------

Forms 10-K until 2011 that [t]he per share estimated market value of common stock is deemed to 
be the offering price of the shares, which currently is $11.00 per share without disclosing that 
$11.00 did not reflect a meaningful estimate of the underlying value of the units.    

       3.     Additionally, AR6, AR7, and AR8 failed to devise and maintain sufficient 
disclosure controls and procedures to meaningfully evaluate whether changes in market conditions 
or other factors required changes to their valuation disclosures.  Consequently, despite receiving 
internal and third-party analyses  indicating a value below $11.00 per unit and despite significant 
decreases in operating performance, AR6, AR7, and AR8 collectively sold more than 25 million 
DRIP units following the 2008 global financial crisis while maintaining that the arbitrarily 
established initial offering price of $11.00 constituted the fair market value of their DRIP units in 
their Forms S-3 and the estimated market value of their units in their Forms 10-K.   

       4.     The Apple REITs also   failed to disclose numerous related party transactions 
involving short-term transfers between REITs to meet cash needs and commercial loans personally 
guaranteed by Knight between 2008 and 2011  .  As part of their business model, the Apple REITs 
historically have maintained little cash on hand, relying on cash flows from operations and, as 
necessary, credit facilities.  However, rather than obtaining additional commercial credit or 
requesting funds from the third-party management companies contained in the operating bank 
accounts of hotels, Apple REIT management engaged in approximately 25 short-term cash  
transfers between the Apple REITs  which  at all times were separate companies with separate 
boards of directors and separate unitholders.  The short-term cash transfers typically were repaid 
within a few days, ranged in amounts from $25,000 to $20 million, and were used to, among other 
things, fund acquisitions, distributions and redemptions, and to cover clearing checks and debt .  
Further, Knight personally guaranteed several short-term commercial loans to the Apple REITs, 
some of which were used to fund shareholder redemptions.  Neither the short -term transfers nor the 
fact of Knights personal guarantee was disclosed to unitholders. 

       5.     The Apple REITs further failed to disclose significant compensation paid by the 
advisers and Knight to their executive officers between 2008 and 2010.  Specifically, the Apple 
REIT advisers, which at all relevant times were private companies wholly owned by Knight, paid 
undisclosed supplemental compensation out of funds belonging to the advisers to certain executive 
officers for work they performed for the REITs.  Knight also sold the economic benefits associated 
with Series B convertible shares issued to Knight to certain executive officers, including Peery, to 
supplement their compensation, which was not disclosed to unitholders.  The undisclosed related 
party transactions and undisclosed supplemental compensation contradicted affirmative disclosures 
to unitholders  including representations that the independent directors would affirmatively 
approve transactions between the REITs and their affiliates  and  demonstrated insufficient 
internal controls.

                                    RELEVANT ENTITY 

       16.    Apple Fund Management, LLC (AFM), a wholly owned subsidiary of AR6 
during the relevant time period, was an entity utilized by the advisers, which have no employees, to 
provide the management services, including the executive officers, required by the advisory 
contracts to, inter alia            , AR6, AR7, AR8, and AR9.  Previously, AFM was a subsidiary of Apple 
Hospitality Five, Inc. (AH5).  After AH5 merged with a third party in 2007, the board of 
directors transferred AFM to AR6. 

                                            FACTS 

A.     Background 

       17.    The Apple REITs are non-traded REITs that, during the relevant period, primarily 
owned full service, limited service, and extended stay hotels.  As REITs, they are not subject to 
federal corporate income taxation as long as they meet certain requirements such as the distribution 
of at least 90% of their taxable income annually to unitholders in dividends.  The Apple REITs 
have a class of securities registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and are subject to the 
                                                 
2
 In 1976, the Commission settled an action, SEC v. Goodman Securities Corp., et al., CA 76-0007-R (E.D. Va. 
1976), involving Knight and others for alleged disclosure violations in connection with a real estate limited 
partnership offering.  See also In the Matter of Glade M. Knight, et al.                                    , Admin. Proc. File 35138, Release No. 13087 
(Dec. 21, 1976). 
                                               5

reporting requirements of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, but their units are not publicly 
traded, and generally are considered illiquid.  The Apple REITs represent to unitholders that, 
although there can be no assurance that this event will occur, they expect that within 
approximately seven years from the initial closing they will execute a liquidity event such as 
causing the common shares to be listed on a national securities exchange or merging with a REIT 
or similar investment vehicle.   

       18.     Each of the Apple REITs is a separate reporting company with separate unitholders  .  
However, by virtue of the advisers reliance on AFM, a wholly owned subsidiary of AR6, to 
provide employees and management services to the Apple REITs, the Apple REITs share common 
corporate management.  Third-party management companies manage the day-to-day operations of 
the hotels under the supervision of the advisory companies.    

       19.     The Apple REITs were    sold through their exclusive selling agent, as best efforts, 
blind pool offerings at an offering price of $11.00 per share.3
                                                              The Form S-11 registration 
statements represented that the per-unit offering prices have been established arbitrarily  and 
may not reflect the true value of the [u]nits; therefore, investors may be paying more for a [u]nit 
than the [u]nit is actually worth.  Except for limited redemption programs, there is no public 
market for the Apple REITs.   

       20.     Pursuant to redemption programs, unitholders  of AR6, AR7, AR8, and AR9 who 
had held their shares for at least one year were permitted to request unit redemptions on a quarterly 
basis.  Pursuant to SEC guidance concerning tender offers, no more than 5%   of the weighted 
average number of units outstanding could  be redeemed during any 12-month period.  If 
shareholder requests exceeded the number of shares that were authorized to be redeemed during 
any quarter, the Apple REITs redeemed on a pro rata basis.   

       21.     Following the close of their initial offerings, the Apple REITs each instituted a 
DRIP wherein they each sold DRIP units on a monthly basis during the relevant period.  4
                                                                                          The 
Apple REITs primarily  used the DRIP proceeds to redeem units under their limited unit 
redemption programs.  Under the terms of the unit redemption programs, the number of units 
redeemed could not  exceed the aggregate net proceeds received from DRIP sales and the additional 
share option program.          

       22.     Between at least 2008 and 2012, the Apple REITs each paid between 7% and 8% in 
distributions (which generally included a component of return of capital), with the exception of 
AR8, which lowered its distribution to 5% in June of 2011.  The Apple REITs generally have paid 
more in distributions than they generated in cash from operations.  The Apple REITs disclosed in 
their Form S-11 registration statements that, although they generally seek to make distributions 

                                                 
3
 Units are initially sold at $10.50 per share until the minimum offering is complete.   
4
 The Apple REITs DRIPs were continuous offerings during the relevant period.  However,  AR6 suspended its 
DRIP in November 2012 upon execution of its merger agreement with an unrelated third party according to public 
filings.  AR7, AR8, and AR9 also suspended their DRIPs and redemptions on or about June 27, 2013 in connection 
with the evaluation of a potential consolidation transaction in which AR7, AR8 and AR9 would be combined 
according to a Form 8-K filed on June 27, 2013.  
                                                6

from operating revenues, they may pay distributions in part from financing proceeds or other 
sources, including offering proceeds.   

B.     Misstatements and Omissions Concerning Valuation  

       23.     During the relevant period, AR6, AR7, and AR8 made material     misstatements and 
omissions concerning valuation in their Form S-3 DRIP registration statements and in certain of 
their Forms 10-K. 5
                    Additionally, the Apple REITs did not have sufficient controls  in place to 
meaningfully evaluate whether changes in market conditions or other factors required changes to 
their valuation disclosures in their Forms S-3 and Forms 10-K. 

       24.     Item 5 of Form S-3 requires registrants to include a description pursuant to Item 
505 of Regulation S-K of the various factors considered in determining [the] offering price 
where common equity is being registered for which there is no established public trading market. 
Item 5 of Form 10-K requires registrants to furnish pursuant to Item 201 of Regulation S-K certain 
high and low bid information if the principal United States market is not an exchange and to 
qualify such quotations with an appropriate explanation [w]here there is an absence of an 
established public trading market.       

       25.     In a section titled, How are unit prices determined?                 , the Apple REITs initial 
Forms S-3 registration statements, as drafted by outside counsel, represented that:6
                                                                                    
 
                    The price of units purchased under the plan directly from 
               us by dividend reinvestments will be based on the fair market 
               value of our units as of the reinvestment date as determined in 
               good faith by our board of directors from time to time.  
                    Our units are not publicly traded; consequently, there is no 
               established public trading market for our units on which we could 
               readily rely in determining fair market value . Nevertheless, the 
               board has determined that, for purposes of this plan, at any given 
               time the most recent price at which an unrelated person has 
               purchased our units represents the fair market value                     of our units. 
               Consequently, unless and until the board decides to use a different 
               method for determining the fair market value  of our units, the 
               per unit price for the plan will be determined at all times based on 
               the most recent price at which an unrelated person has purchased 
               our units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors                                              may 
               determine a different fair market value and price for our units for 
               purposes of this plan if (1) in the good faith judgment of the board

 Although AR9 made substantially similar representations in its DRIP plan filed on December 10, 2010, AR9 did 
not have the same type of operating history available and rarely was included in the internal and third-party strategic 
planning analyses that contradicted the disclosures at issue.      
6
 The Form S-3 filed by AR6 on February 10, 2006, used the term distribution rather than dividend in the first 
sentence of the disclosure, but it was changed to the above quoted language for AR6s Form S-3 filed on May 14, 
2009.  
                                                 7  
---------------------Page 8---------------------

               an amount of time has elapsed since our units have been purchased 
               by unrelated persons such that the price paid by such persons would 
               not be indicative of the fair market value  of our units or (2)  our 
               board determines that there are other factors relevant to such fair 
               market value. (emphasis added)      7
                                                       

       26.     Outside counsel drafted the language at issue in part to comply with certain federal 
tax requirements prohibiting the deduction of preferential distributions by REITs, which, as 
disclosed in the Forms S-3, could subject the REIT[s] to federal corporate income taxes which 
most likely would reduce the after-tax yield on any distributions to shareholders.  The Forms S-3 
represented that [t]o avoid this result under [the] plan, a reasonably accurate determination of 
the fair market value of units by [the REITs] board[s] of directors is required. (emphasis 
added.)   

       27.     Although the Forms S-3 disclosed that the per unit price for the plan will be 
determined at all times based on the most recent price at which an unrelated person has purchased 
our units, the disclosures omitted to state that the fair market value of the units was not based on 
an appraisal of the Apple REITs assets or other valuation methodology.  They also failed to 
disclose that, in contrast to an actively traded market, the price last paid for a DRIP share by an 
unrelated person in the context of a non-traded REIT did not reflect a meaningful estimate of the 
underlying or realizable value of the units.    

       28.     In addition, following the 2008 global financial crisis until the fiscal year ended 
December 31, 2011, AR6, AR7, and AR8 represented in their Forms 10-K that [t]he per share 
estimated market value of common stock is deemed to be the offering price of the shares, which 
currently is $11.00 per share. (emphasis added)  The Forms 10-K further represented that the 
disclosed estimated market value of $11.00 was supported by the fact that the [REITs are] 
currently selling shares to the public at a price of $11.00 per share through  Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan[s].  8
                          However, the Forms 10- K failed to disclose that $11.00 did not reflect a 
meaningful estimate of the underlying value of the units.    

       29.     Consequently, AR6, AR7, and AR8 maintained the arbitrarily established initial 
offering price of $11.00 as the fair market value and the estimated market value of the units 
following the 2008 global financial crisis despite internal and third-party analyses suggesting that 
the per unit values of the Apple REITs were below $11.00 and despite declines in operating 
performance.        
                                                 
7
 AR7 filed an amended and restated Form S-3 on January 13, 2012, which, among other things, disclosed that the 
market value of [its] units and the unit price of units purchased from [it] under the plan will not be based on an 
appraisal or other valuation of [AR7], [its] net assets, or the units, and will not necessarily reflect [its] value, earnings, 
net worth or other measures of value, but rather will be deemed equal to the most recent price at which an unrelated 
person has purchased our units from [it].  AR7, AR8, and AR9 filed post-effective amendments to their Forms S-3 on 
February 19, 2013 incorporating substantially similar language.  
8
 The Apple REITs stopped using the term estimated market value in Item 5 in their Forms 10 -K for the fiscal year 
ended December 31, 2011.  Further, in their Forms 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, the Apple 
REITs disclosed that the $11.00 price (or $10.25 in the case of AR9 due to a  special distribution of $0.75 to 
unitholders relating to an asset sale on April 27, 2012) [was] not based on an appraisal or valuation of the Company 
or its assets.   
                                                  8

Internal and Third-Party Analyses Contradicted AR6, AR7, and AR8s Valuation Disclosures 

       30.     Following the 2008 global financial crisis, Apple REIT management received 
internal strategic planning analyses between late 2008 and 2011 that contradicted the REITs 
representations that $11.00 constituted the fair market value of the units in their Form S-3 and 
the estimated market value of the units in their Forms 10-K.   

       31.     For example, in late 2008, an Apple REIT employee created a basic  model for an 
executive officer estimating AR6, AR7, and AR8s performance over a five year period.  The 
model was linked directly to the accounting system, was updated regularly through at least mid-
2011 and was distributed to certain members of management.  Alt  hough the primary purpose of the 
model related to evaluating future cash flow performance, the model included an estimated market 
value section calculating the REITs enterprise, equity and per share values.   The estimated market 
values of the AR6, AR7 and AR8 mostly showed per share values below $11.00.  A      different 
analysis performed by the same  Apple REIT employee for an executive officer in August 2009 
showed that, without substantial revenue and FFO 9
                                                   increases, the per share values of AR6, AR7, 
and AR8 would be below $11.00. 

       32.     In addition, starting in approximately mid-2009 through mid-2011, several third-
party investment banks made presentations to Apple REIT management concerning potential 
strategic options for the Apple REITs.  The estimated valuations included in these presentations 
varied and were not a static $11.00 per unit for AR6, AR7, and AR8 as represented in their Forms 
S-3 and Forms 10-K.  Some of the per-unit valuations were below $11.00 for AR6 and most of the 
per unit valuation estimates were below $11.00 for AR7 and AR8.   

AR6, AR7, and AR8s Economic Performance Contradicted the Valuation Disclosures  

       33.     AR6, AR7, and AR8s operating performance following the 2008 global financial 
crisis also  should have caused the Apple REITs to amend their disclosure of $11.00 as a fair 
market value and estimated market value of units.  AR6, AR7, and AR8s net incomes declined 
more than 40% in 2009 as compared to 2008, and remain   ed below 2008 levels through at least 
December 31, 2012.   

       34.     Further, given the up-front fees and ramp up periods10
                                                                     for the properties, Apple 
REIT management knew that growth would be required to reach a fair market value of $11.00 per 
share, and further knew or should have known that the economic performance of the REITs 
between 2009 and at least 2011 fell short of that growth level.   

       35.     AR6, AR7, and AR8 also increased their debt levels between 2008 and 2012.  
Increased debt levels may affect the Apple REITs valuations because any debt incurred by the 
                                                 
9
 FFO, or Funds From Operations, is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as net 
income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains/losses on sales of depreciable property, plus 
depreciation and amortization of real property used in operations, less preferred dividends and after adjustments for 
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
10
  Ramp up period is a term used by the REITs management to describe the 6 to 24-month period following 
initial property purchase or construction needed to position the property to reach the expected level of return 
through, for example, improved management or improved marketing .                                  
                                                9  
---------------------Page 10---------------------

REITs must eventually be repaid, thereby reducing the equity available for distribution to 
unitholders in connection with a liquidity event.  AR6, AR7, and AR8 nonetheless never adjusted 
the $11.00 per unit valuation disclosures. 

Failure to Implement Sufficient Processes or Procedures to Evaluate the Valuation Disclosures  

       36.    Despite the representation in the Forms S-3 that the Apple REITs boards of 
directors would determine in good faith   the fair market value of the DRIP units from time-to-time, 
the Apple REITs failed to develop or maintain sufficient procedures relating to the disclosure of 
the valuation of units sold in the DRIPs.  The Apple REITs did not establish a valuation committee 
or valuation working group.  Nor did they establish any formal or informal valuation guidelines or 
otherwise attempt to identify relevant factors for determining fair market value.  Further, 
management did not provide the boards of directors with the contradictory internal valuations 
discussed in paragraph 31 or the contradictory third-party valuations for consideration in 
determining fair market value.  

       37.    Consideration of the fair market value of the units for purposes of the DRIP was not 
included as a formal agenda item for board meetings.  Although the directors periodically 
discussed the DRIP program during board meetings, a record of substantive discussion concerning 
DRIP prices at board meetings does not appear in meeting minutes   until February 2012 even 
though the DRIP programs for AR6, AR7, and AR8 had been in place since 2006, 2007 and 2008, 
respectively.   That discussion was recorded merely as: There was  a discussion concerning 
DRIP and redemption pricing.  Those in attendance considered the price currently paid ($11 per 
unit) to be appropriate and would reconsider if at some point it is warranted.  Rather, the boards of 
directors operated under the theory that as long as there were DRIP sales, they did not need to 
reconsider the unit price. 

C.     Undisclosed Related Party Transactions:  Short-Term Transfers Between REITs to 
       Meet Cash Needs and Commercial Loans Personally Guaranteed by Knight  

       38.    Between 2008 and 2011, the Apple REITs, which were separate companies with 
separate unitholders and boards of directors at all relevant times, engaged in numerous   undisclosed 
cash transfers between REITs to meet short-term cash needs and obtained certain commercial loans 
personally guaranteed by Knight, which were undisclosed.  The Apple REITs executed most of 
these undisclosed related party transactions without following internal controls described in public 
filings, including a disclosed policy that such transactions would be approved by an affirmative 
vote of the independent directors.  Further, although the boards of directors had adopted general 
borrowing resolutions for each of the REITs, the independent directors did not affirmatively 
approve the fact of the personal guarantee by Knight or the short-term transfers. 

       39.    Item 7 of Form 10-K and  Item 3 of Form 10-Q both require registrants to identify 
and separately describe internal and external sources of liquidity pursuant to Item 303 of 
Regulation S-K, which requires identification of any known demands, commitments, events or 
uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the registrants liquidity 
increasing or decreasing in any material way.  Item 13 of Form 10-K and Item 7 of Schedule 14A 
both require registrants to describe any transaction  in which the registrant was or is to be a 
                                              10   
---------------------Page 11---------------------

participant and the amount involve  d exceeds $120,000, and in which any related person had or will 
have a direct or indirect material interest,11
                                               and to disclose the registrants policies and 
procedures for the review, approval, or ratification  of such related party transactions pursuant to 
Item 404 Regulation S-K.  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 850- 10 (hereinafter ASC 
850-10), Related Party Disclosures,   12
                                         requires the disclosure of material related party transactions 
in the financial statements, even if no or nominal amounts were ascribed thereto.    13
                                                                                        Additionally, 
the Commission issued a statement in January 2002 providing that registrants should include a 
discussion of material related party transactions in their Managements Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A).   

Undisclosed Cash Transfers Between REITs To        Meet Short-Term Cash Needs 

        40.     As part of their business model, the Apple REITs historically have maintained little 
cash on hand, relying on cash flows from operations and, as necessary, credit facilities.  On 
approximately 25 occasions between 2008 and 2011, rather than obtaining additional commercial 
credit or attempting to obtain funds  from the third-party management companies contained in the 
operating bank accounts of hotels, Peery, in consultation with other members of management, 
effectuated or authorized undisclosed, short-term cash transfers between REITs  which are 
separate companies with separate unitholders  to meet short-term cash needs     .  The  transfers at 
issue ranged between $25,000 and $20 million.    14
                                                     The borrowing REIT typically repaid the 
transfer within a few days, and used the assets in connection with property acquisitions, 
redemptions and distributions, and to cover clearing checks and debt    .  The Apple REITs records 
lacked sufficient detail to determine the business purpose of certain of the transfers.   

        41.     The Apple REITs recorded the transfers between the separate companies in 
intercompany accounts as opposed to as payables and receivables, and, except for one of the       
largest transfers, did not execute loan documentation or, except for the  two largest transfers, did 
not charge interest.  In addition, the Apple REITs failed to record four of the transfers in their 
general ledgers.  The Apple REITs also failed to disclose as a source of liquidity pursuant to Item 
303 that they adopted a cash management policy in 2011 providing for transfers up to $1 million 
between REITs to cover, among other things, unanticipated cash need[s].     
                                                 
11
  The Instructions to Item 404(a) define related person to include any director or executive officer of the 
registrant.  Transaction is defined to include any financial transactions, arrangement, or relationship (including any 
indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships.  
Under Item 404(a), a related persons indirect material interest in a firm, corporation, or other entity engaging in a 
transaction with the registrant may require disclosure of certain details concerning the transaction.   
12
  ASC 850-10 formerly was Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 57 prior to the September 
2009 codification.  
13
  ASC 850-10 defines affiliates as related parties, and provides that similar related party transactions may be 
aggregated by type.  Affiliate is defined as [a] party that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, 
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an entity.  Related Party is defined to include [o]ther 
parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties. 
14
  The $20 million transfer, which was largest of the undisclosed transfers at issue, involved a situation in which 
AR8 purchased a $100 million Certificate of Deposit (CD), but subsequently identified properties for 
acquisition.  The closing date for some of the properties was scheduled before the maturity of the CD.   Rather than 
seeking an early withdrawal from AR8s CD, Peery, in consultation with others in management, transferred $20 
million from AR9 to AR8, which AR8 repaid with interest in the amount matching that earned in the CD 
approximately one month later.  
                                                   11   
---------------------Page 12---------------------

       42.     The majority of the transactions at issue exceeded the $120,000 Item 404 disclosure 
threshold, even before aggregating similar transactions.15
                                                           Further,  the practice of making periodic 
short-term transfers between the REITs to meet cash needs was material due to qualitative factors 
and required to be disclosed because it facilitated their business practice of maintaining little cash 
on hand during the relevant period.  For example, the related party nature of the  relationship 
between the REITs was important    to this cash management tool because common management 
controlled all the relevant bank accounts and could make book transfers between REITs following 
which the transferred funds were immediately available for use .  Additionally, unlike in connection 
with borrowing on commercial credit lines, no advance notice was needed to execute transfers 
between REITs.  However, Peery treated these transactions as immaterial for disclosure purposes 
because, among other reasons, they typically were repaid within a few days.  

Undisclosed Loans Personally Guaranteed by Knight 

       43.     Between 2009 and 2010, Knight personally guaranteed, and provided personal 
assets as collateral for, four short-term commercial loans and lines of credit to AR6 and AR7: $10 
million in July 2009 to AR6; $2 million in April 2010 to AR6; $2 million in April 2010 to AR7; 
and $9 million in July 2010 to AR7.  With the exception of the $9 million loan to AR7, neither the 
loans nor the personal guarantees were disclosed to unitholders as required by ASC 850-10 and 
Items 303 and 404 of Regulation S-K.  Although the $9 million loan was disclosed, Knights 
personal guarantee was not disclosed.  Peery and others were aware of these loans.  
                                                                                     

       44.     AR6 and AR7 obtained these personally guaranteed loans and lines of credit in part 
to fund redemption payments during periods when the Apple REITs had borrowed the maximum 
available on their existing lines of credit.  Knight received no compensation or other benefit in 
exchange for his personal guarantee.  

The Short-Term Transfers and Personally Guaranteed Loans at Issue Contradicted Internal 
Controls and Affirmative Disclosures to Unitholders   

       45.     The undisclosed short -term cash transfers between REITs and  the undisclosed 
personally guaranteed loans, contradicted several affirmative disclosures and internal controls set 
forth in the Apple REITs public disclosures.   

       46.     The Forms S-11 represented that it was the Apple REITs policy not to sell, 
transfer or lend assets or property to any of [their] affiliates nor to purchase, borrow, or 
otherwise acquire assets or property from any of [their] affiliates unless the transactions were 
approved by an affirmative vote of the majority of independent directors.  The Apple REITs  
bylaws, which are exhibits to numerous public filings, contained similar language. 16
                                                                                      Although the 
                                                 
15
  The Apple REITs amended their Form 10-K disclosures for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 to include 
that the individual companies may make payments for any or all of the related companies in order [t]o efficiently 
manage cash disbursements and that [t]he amounts due to or from the related individual companies are reimbursed 
or collected and are not significant in amount.   However, these amended disclosures failed to accurately 
characterize the nature, frequency and purpose of the transfers between REITs.  Additionally, s ome of the 2010 cash 
transfers exceeded Item 404s $120,000 disclosure threshold, even before aggregating similar transactions. 
16
  AR8 and AR9s Forms S-11 also represented that a majority of disinterested directors would approve any material 
agreement or arrangement between, or transactions involving the Apple REITs and their affiliates, and that the 
                                                 12   
---------------------Page 13---------------------

boards of directors had adopted general borrowing resolutions for each REIT, management failed 
to seek the affirmative approval of the independent directors for all but one of the undisclosed 
short-term transfers and personally guaranteed loans at issue.   

        47.     Some of the undisclosed transfers between REITs also were inconsistent with       
representations to unitholders concerning the use of proceeds.  Neither the Forms S-11 nor the 
Forms S-3, which specifically set forth the use of proceeds, disclosed the possibility that a REIT 
might use investor assets to make loans to affiliates.17
                                                          The Forms S -11 also represented that [t]he 
proceeds of [the] offering [would] be received and held in trust for the benefit of the investors in 
compliance with applicable securities laws, to be used only for the purposes set forth in [the] 
prospectus.   Additionally, the Forms S-11 stated that the Apple REITs expect[ed] borrowings to 
come from third party, non-affiliated lenders, and that they had no current plan or intention to 
make loans to other persons or entities.  18
                                               

        48.     The advisory agreements provided that     either the REITs paid directly or the 
advisers paid and sought reimbursement for certain enumerated expenses on behalf of the Apple 
REITs, such as distributions to unitholders , interest expense, and all costs of personnel.  The 
advisory agreements also required the   advisers to prepare statements documenting any such 
reimbursable expenses within 45 days and required     the Apple REITs to reimburse the advisers 
within 60 days after the end of the quarter.  Here, rather than following the procedures outlined in 
the advisory agreements, Peery authorized and/or transferr   ed funds directly between the Apple 
REITs in varying amounts and at varying intervals as cash needs arose.  In addition, 
notwithstanding their actual cash management practices, AR6, AR7, AR8, AR9 misrepresented 
that the expense reimbursements flowed from the Apple REITs to their advisers consistent with the 
advisory agreements in their Forms 10-K for 2008 and 2009 and in their proxies filed in 2008, 
2009, and 2010.  19
                       

D.     Undisclosed Compensation Arrangements  

        49.     AR6, AR7, AR8 and AR9 failed to disclose material compensation arrangements in 
their Forms 10-K for 2008, 2009, and 2010, and in their Schedule 14A proxy statements, including 
those filed in April 2011 in which they solicited nonbinding advisory votes approving executive 
compensation (i.e., say-on-pay votes). 

                                                                                                                                                             
officers, directors and employees were required to report to the board related party transactions where the amount 
exceeded $120,000. 
17
  The Forms S-11 represented that the proceeds of the offering would be used to pay organization expenses, to 
repay any outstanding balance on the Apple REITs lines of credit, to pay expenses and fees of selling the units , to 
invest in properties, to pay expenses associated with acquisition properties, and to establish a working capital 
reserve.  The Form S -3 registration statements provided that the REITs expected to use the proceeds from DRIP 
sales for general corporate purposes which may include redeeming units, enhancing properties, satisfying financing 
obligations and other expenses, increasing working capital, funding various corporate operations, and acquiring 
hotels or other properties. 
18
  The Forms S-11 represented that the unitholders were entitled to rely on the fiduciary duties of the advisers and 
similar duties of officers to provide substantial protection for unitholders interests. 
19
  The Apple REITs Form 10-K disclosures continued to be materially misleading in 2010 and 2011 because they 
state that expenses were reimbursed by the advisers to AR6 (as the owner of AFM) or paid directly to AR6 on behalf 
of the advisers when they knew or should have known that the payments were always made directly between REITs.  
                                                  13

         50.     Item 11 of Form 10-K and Item 8 of Schedule 14A       20
                                                                          both require that registrants 
 furnish the information required by Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including clear, concise and 
 understandable disclosure of all plan and non-plan compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to 
 the named executive officers  by any person for all services rendered in all capacities to the 
 registrant and its subsidiaries, including compensation involving transactions between the 
 registrant and a third party where a purpose of the transaction is to furnish compensation to any 
 such named executive officer or director.    

 Failure to Disclose Payments from the Advisers to the Apple REITs Officers 

         51.     Knight, the 100% owner of the advisers to the Apple REITs, entered into written 
 agreements with four executive officers, including Peery (    as to A8A and A9A only) to share 
 profits earned by the advisers.  Although the supplemental compensation was paid from the assets 
 of the advisers, and  although the Apple REITs disclosed the advisory fees from which the 
 payments to executive officers were made, they failed to disclose the profit-sharing agreement in 
 their Forms 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010, or in the proxy 
 statements incorporated by reference therein, thereby materially understating the compensation 
 paid to executive officers.   

         52.     The total amount of undisclosed compensation paid by the advisers exceeded        the 
 disclosed compensation for executive officers     by between $85,375 and    $1.197 million per REIT as 
 presented in the compensation tables in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010.

 Failure to Disclose the Sale of Benefits Relating to B Shares from the CEO to Executive Officers 
 of the Apple REITs 

         53.     AR6, AR7, AR8, and AR9 failed to disclose in the Forms 10-       K and Schedule 14A 
 proxy statements as required by Item 402 of Regulation S-K that Knight sold the economic 
 benefits relating to nearly 30% of his Series B convertible preferred shares (B shares) in AR6, 
 AR7, AR8, and AR9 to certain officers of the Apple REITs       , including Peery, to supplement the 
 compensation paid to those officers.    

         54.     Depending on its size, each REIT issued between 240,000 and 480,000 B shares to 
 Knight in his capacity as founder at $0.10 per share.  The B shares are convertible into common 

                                                  
 20
    Schedule 14As requirement to disclose the information required by Item 402  and Item 404 of Regulation S-K 
 applies if action is to be taken with respect to, among other things, election of directors, which was the case in all the 
 Apple REITs relevant Schedule 14A filings.   
                                                    14   
---------------------Page 15---------------------

shares upon the occurrence of certain events such as a sale or transfer of substantially all of the 
REITs assets, or a listing on any securities exchange.       

       55.     The executive officers paid $0.10 per share to Knight for the economic benefits 
associated with the B shares transferred to them.  The interest in the B shares represented 
compensation for work done for the REITs and their advis  ers that should have been disclosed. 

       56.     Knights sale of benefits relating to the B shares also was inconsistent with 
affirmative disclosures in each of the Apple REITs Schedule 14A proxy statements that Knight 
was the 100% owner of those shares, and disclosures in the Forms 10-K that all of the B shares 
were issued to Knight.      

Misstatements  and Omissions in the Apple REITs Compensation Discussion and Analysis Section 
of their Proxy Statements 

       57.     Given the fact of undisclosed compensation described above, the Apple REITs also 
misstated or omitted material information required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K from the 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of their proxy statements filed in 2009, 2010, and 
2011.  Item 402(b) requires a discussion of all material elements of the registrants compensation 
of the executive officers including information concerning the registrants compensation 
objectives and rationale.  

       58.     The Apple REITs represent  ed to unitholders, without disclosing the payments to 
executive officers by the advisers or the B Share sales, that the base salaries and bonuses for the 
executive officers are designed to be competitive with comparable employers and that the  REITs 
believe that a simplistic approach to compensation better matches the objectives of all 
stakeholders.  They also represented that their executive officer compensation targets were 
developed using comparisons to compensation paid by other public hospitality REITs and that 
the targets were set sufficiently high to attract and retain a strong and motivated leadership team, 
but not so high that it creates a negative perception with  other stakeholders.   

E.     Failure to Timely File Forms 3 and Forms 4 

       59.     The directors and executive officers of the Apple REITs were subject to the 
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires the filing of 
beneficial ownership forms with the Commission.  Section 16(a) and Rule 16a-3 of the Exchange 
Act require directors and officers to file initial reports of ownership on Form 3 and changes of 
ownership on Form 4 with the Commission.    21
                                               During the relevant period, Glade Knight  failed to 
timely file one Form 3 and one Form 4  related to AR9 .  Bryan Peery failed to timely file one Form 
3 relating to AR9.   

                                                 
21
  Section 16(a)(2) requires that a reporting person of an issuer that is registering securities for the first time under 
Section 12 of the Exchange Act must file Form 3 no later than the effective date of the registration statement.  Once 
the initial report is filed, any changes in holdings must be reported on Form 4 within two business days of the 
change.  
                                                15   
---------------------Page 16---------------------

       60.     In addition, Item 10 of Form 10-K and Item 7 of Schedule 14A both require 
disclosure of the information required by Item 405 of Regulation S-K, including any reporting 
violations by insiders in a clearly marked section, the number of late reports, the number of 
transactions not reported on a timely basis, and any known failure to file a required Form.  Item 
405 explicitly states that a known failure to file includes a failure to file a Form 3, which is 
required of all reporting persons.  AR6, AR7, AR8 and AR9 misrepresented in their proxy 
statements until April 2011 that the Apple REITs executive officers had filed reports with the 
Commission with respect to their initial ownership of common shares and that the REITs  believed 
that each of its officers complied with any applicable filing requirements.   

                                        VIOLATIONS 

       61.     In the offer or sale of securities, Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act makes it 
unlawful to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any 
omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and Section 17(a)(3) proscribes any 
transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on 
the purchaser. Violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) may be established by a showing of 
negligence.   

       62.     Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers that have securities registered 
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file such periodic and other reports as the 
Commission may prescribe and in conformity with such rules as the Commission may promulgate. 
Exchange Act Rules 13a-1and 13a-13 require the filing of annual and quarterly reports, 
respectively.  In addition to the information expressly required to be included in such reports, Rule 
12b-20 under the Exchange Act requires issuers to add such further material information, if any, as 
may be necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which 
they are made, not misleading.  A violation of the reporting provisions is established if a report is 
shown to contain materially false or misleading information.  No showing of scienter is necessary 
to establish a violation of Section 13(a).  

       63.     Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to make and keep books, 
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the issuer.  Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers 
to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable 
assurances that, among other things, transactions are executed in accordance with managements 
general or specific authorization and that transactions are recorded to permit the preparation of 
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other 
criteria applicable to such statements and to maintain accountability for assets.  No showing of 
scienter is required to establish a violation of Section 13(b)(2)(A) or Section 13(b)(2)(B).   

       64.     Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, among other things, requires principal executive 
officers and principal financial officers to certify in quarterly and annual reports filed under 
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act certain information in the form set forth in Item 601(b)(31)(i) of 
Regulation S-K, including, inter alia, that they have reviewed the reports, that they are responsible 

                                               16   
---------------------Page 17---------------------

for designing and maintaining certain controls, and that they have designed or caused the design of 
such controls. 

       65.     Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires registrants that solicit any proxy or 
consent or authorization in connection with any security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the 
Exchange Act (other than an exempted security) to comply with such rules as the Commission may 
promulgate.  Exchange Act Rule 14a-9 prohibits the use of proxy statements containing materially 
false or misleading statements or materially misleading omissions.  No showing of scienter is 
required to establish a violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule14a-9 thereunder.  

       66.     Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder require, inter alia, 
timely and accurate filing of Forms 3 and Forms 4 with the Commission.  

       67.     By engaging in the conduct described above relating to valuation, AR6, AR7, and 
AR8 violated Section 17(a)(2) and Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.   

       68.     By engaging in the conduct described above, AR6, AR7, AR8, and AR9 violated 
Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 
13a-13, and 14a  -9 thereunder. 

       69.     By engaging in the conduct described above, Knight and Peery each  caused AR6, 
AR7, AR8 and AR9s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 14(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b    -20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a  -9 thereunder, and Knight 
and Peery each violated Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 
16a-3. 

       70.     By engaging in the conduct described above, A6A, A7A, A8A, and A9A caused, 
respectively, AR6, AR7, AR8, and AR9s violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 
and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder. 
 
                                      UNDERTAKINGS 

       Respondents AR7, AR8, AR9,     22
                                        and their successors, have undertaken to: 

       71.     AR7, AR8, and AR9, and/or their successors,  each will maintain a Disclosure 
Committee that will be responsible for oversight of disclosures made to their respective securities 
holders in order to ensure accurate, complete, and timely disclosure of all matters requiring 
disclosure.  The Disclosure Committee will be chaired by an independent director, and will consist 
of at least three members and outside counsel.  The D isclosure Committee shall meet no less than 
quarterly to review the companies disclosure of financial statements, results of operations, and 
other matters required by the federal securities laws, and shall require all officers and directors to 
submit annual Officer/Director Questionnaires.  
                                                 
22
  The undertakings required by this Order are not applicable to AR6 due to AR6s May 2013 merger with an 
unrelated entity.  According to a Form 15 terminating the registration of shares under Section 12(g) of the Exchange 
Act filed with the Commission on May 14, 2013, AR6 merged into an unrelated entity on  May 14, 2013, at which 
time the separate corporate existence of AR6 ended.   
                                               17   
---------------------Page 18---------------------

       72.    Should AR7, AR8, and AR9, and/or their successors re-establish their DRIPs, AR7, 
AR8, and AR9, and/or their successors, will hire an Independent Consultant, not unacceptable to 
the staff of the Commission, to address the determination of fair market value for purposes of their 
Form S-3 DRIP registration statements, including advising on setting the price for sales thereunder, 
and other public disclosures.  Should AR7, AR8, and AR9, and/or their successors, re-establish 
their DRIPs, AR7, AR8, and AR9,   and/or their successors, will maintain a Valuation Committee 
comprised of independent board members    that will be responsible for the oversight of all valuation 
issues relating to their respective REITs.  Each of the Valuation Committees will establish and 
maintain written policies and procedures relating to valuation of the Apple REITs, and will consult 
with third-party valuation services and/or experts concerning their valuations policies, procedures, 
and methodologies. 

       73.    The independent members of the Boards of Directors of AR7, AR8, and AR9, or 
their successors, will have separate counsel and will meet no less than quarterly outside the 
presence of senior management.  

       74.    AR7, AR8, and AR9, and/or their successors,   will h ire an Independent Consultant, 
not unacceptable to the staff of the Commission, to evaluate and address: (1) policies, procedures, 
and internal controls relating to appropriate oversight by the respective Boards of Directors; (2) 
policies, procedures and internal controls relating to related party transactions; (3) policies, 
procedures and internal controls relating to executive compensation; (4) policies, procedures , and 
internal controls relating to public disclosure, including compliance with applicable disclosure 
requirements; and (5) policies, procedures, and internal controls relating to the oversight of 
external advisers, to the extent utilized, including, but not limited to, evaluation of compliance with 
the advisory agreements and evaluation of adviser performance.  The Independent Consultant will 
review each of the Apple REITs internal accounting, internal controls relating to record-keeping, 
and regulatory and compliance functions, including, but not limited to, compliance with all of the 
provisions found to have been violated by this Order.     

       75.    Management shall provide the Audit Committee or other subcommittee of 
independent directors of AR7, AR8, and AR9, and/or their suc cessors, on a quarterly basis a list of 
all related party transactions, including, but not limited to, transactions, directly or indirectly, 
between or among the separate REITs  , the advisers, members of management, board members, or 
other related parties.  The Audit Committee or other subcommittee of independent directors of 
AR7, AR8, and AR9, and/or their su ccessors, each will undertake to develop and implement 
written internal policies and controls concerning related party transactions, including that all 
related party transactions be recorded on a monthly and quarterly basis in sufficient detail to permit 
the determination of their business purpose, and that the CFO of each of AR7, AR8, and AR9, 
and/or their successors, be designated to ensure compliance with the related party transactions 
policy and to certify compliance on a quarterly basis. 

       76.    AR7, AR8, AR9,  and/or their successors, will require the Independent Consultant s 
to enter into an agreement that provides that for the period of engagement and for a period of two 
years from completion of the engagement, the Independent Consultants shall not enter into any 
employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with AR7, 
AR8, AR9, or their successors, or any of its present or former affiliates, directors, officers, 
                                               18   
---------------------Page 19---------------------

employees, or agents acting in their capacity.  The agreement will also provide that the 
Independent Consultant will require that any firm with which he/she is affiliated or of which he/she 
is a member, and any person engaged to assist the Independent Consultants in performance of 
his/her duties under this Order shall not, without prior written consent of the Commission staff, 
enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship 
with AR7, AR8, AR9, or their successors, or any of its present or former affiliates, directors, 
officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such for the period of the engagement and 
for a period of two years after the engagement.  

       77.    AR7, AR8, AR9, and/or their successors, will c ertify, in writing, compliance with 
the undertaking(s) set forth above.  The certification shall identify the undertaking(s), provide 
written evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be supported by exhibits sufficient 
to demonstrate compliance.  The Commission staff may make reasonable requests for further 
evidence of compliance, and Respondents  agree to provide such evidence.  The certification and 
supporting material shall be submitted to Douglas McAllister, Assistant Director, Division of 
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F St., NE, Washington, DC 20549-6561, 
with a copy to the Office of Chief Counsel of the Enforcement Division, no later than sixty (60) 
days from the date of the completion of the undertakings.   
 
                                              IV. 

       In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions 
agreed to in Respondents Offers. 
 
       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: 
 
       A.     Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Section 21C of the Exchange Act, 
Respondents Apple REIT Six, Inc., Apple REIT Seven, Inc. and Apple REIT Eight, Inc. cease and 
desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 
17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the 
Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 14a-9 thereunder.   

       B.     Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Apple REIT Nine, Inc., 
cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections

and 14a-9 thereunder.   

       C.     Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondents Apple Six Advisors, 
Inc., Apple Seven Advisors, Inc., Apple Eight Advisors, Inc., and Apple Nine Advisors, Inc. cease

13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 
14a-9 thereunder. 

       D.     Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondents Glade M. Knight and

violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 14(a), and 16(a) of the Exchange Act and
