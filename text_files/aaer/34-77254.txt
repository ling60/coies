                                             I. 
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the 
public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, 
instituted pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange 
Act”) against KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. (“Respondent” or “KBCM”).   
                                               
                                             II. 
 
       In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer 
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the 
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the 
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings  
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting 
Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the 
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order 
(“Order”), as set forth below.    
 
                                            III. 
 
                                                                           1

  The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer and are not binding on any other 
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

                                           Summary 
 
       1.     These proceedings concern Respondent’s failure to make and keep accurate books 
and records.  
        
       2.     Respondent, a broker-dealer registered with the Commission, is a subsidiary of 
KeyCorp, a financial services company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. 
        
       3.     Beginning at some point prior to January 2011, and through January 2012, 
Respondent’s then Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) (until November 2011), Jason Maiher, caused 
unsubstantiated or “plug” entries to be made to one or more accounts in Respondent’s general 
ledger.  The amount of the unsubstantiated entries varied over time.     
        
       4.     The plug entries resulted in Respondent reporting unsubstantiated assets in the 
financial statements included in its fiscal year 2010 Annual Audited Report filed with the 
Commission in February 2011 and in its monthly FOCUS Reports filed with FINRA, which then 
furnished the FOCUS Reports to the Commission, including those filed in 2011and January 2012.     
        
       5.     In Respondent’s Annual Audited Report for the year ended December 31, 2011, 
Respondent disclosed that its prior period financial statements (for fiscal year 2010) included 
unsubstantiated assets of $13,679,000 ($8,591,000 net of taxes) and omitted liabilities of 
$4,305,000 ($2,701,000 net of taxes).  Accordingly, Respondent restated net income as $3,136,000 
versus the previously reported $14,428,000 (a 78% reduction) and restated shareholder’s equity 
from $328,088,000 to $316,796,000, as of December 31, 2010.    
        
                                        Respondent 
 
       6.     Respondent is a broker-dealer registered with the Commission and is headquartered 
in Cleveland, Ohio. 
        
                                     Other Relevant Party 
        
       7.     Jason Maiher, age 41, was Respondent’s Chief Financial Officer from April 2007 
through November 2011 and Series 27 Financial and Operations Principal from April 2007 
through December 2011.  Maiher was primarily responsible for maintaining Respondent’s 
financial records and oversaw the filing of its monthly FOCUS Reports with FINRA, which then 
furnished the FOCUS Reports to the Commission.  As required by company policy, Maiher was 
required to certify at the close of each month that Respondent’s general ledger balance sheet 
information had been compared with, and reconciled to, the underlying back-office system 
information from which the general ledger was prepared.   
        
        

                                               2

                           KBCM’s Books and Records Were Inaccurate 
    
       8.      Beginning at some point prior to January 2011 through January 2012, Maiher 
caused unsubstantiated or “plug” entries to be made to one or more accounts in Respondent’s 
general ledger, in order to complete Respondent’s monthly close-the-books process. 
        
       9.      The plug entries resulted in Respondent overstating its assets and income in its 
fiscal year 2010 financial statements, which were included in its fiscal year 2010 Annual Audited 
Report filed with the Commission in February 2011.  Maiher signed this report, affirming that the 
accompanying financial statements were “true and correct.”   
        
       10.    The plug entries to the general ledger also resulted in inaccurate financial 
information being included in Respondent’s monthly FOCUS Reports that Maiher caused to be 
filed with FINRA, which then furnished the FOCUS Reports to the Commission, in January 2011 
through January 2012 , among other months. 
        
       11.    In its Annual Audited Report for the year ended December 31, 2011, Respondent 
disclosed that its prior period financial statements (for fiscal year 2010) included unsubstantiated 
assets of $13,679,000 ($8,591,000 net of taxes) and omitted liabilities of $4,305,000 ($2,701,000 
net of taxes).  The firm’s write-off of the unsubstantiated assets and accrual of the unrecorded 
liabilities resulted in restated net income of $3,136,000, a 78% reduction versus the previously 
reported $14,428,000, and restated shareholder’s equity of $316,796,000, an $11,292,000 
reduction from the previously reported $328,088,000. 
          
                                                                                  2
       12.    As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent willfully      violated Sections  
17(a)   and 17(e) of  the Exchange Act and Rules 17a- 3 (a)(2)    and 17a- 5 (a) and (d) thereunder, which 
require broker  - dealers to make and keep current books and records, and to make  certain reports and 
filings as required by the Comm  issio n. 
                                                 IV. 
                                                    
        In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to 
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent KBCM’s Offer. 
 
        Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby 
ORDERED that:

 A willful violation of the securities laws means merely “‘that the person charged with the duty 
knows what he is doing.’” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting 
Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949)).  There is no requirement that the actor 
“‘also be aware that he is violating one of the Rules or Acts.’” Id. (quoting Gearhart & Otis, Inc. 
v. SEC, 348 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C. Cir. 1965)). 
                                                  3
