                                        I.  
 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate 
and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, 
and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Sections 4C, 15(b) and 21C of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice against Jason Maiher (“Respondent” or “Maiher”).   
                                         
                                       II. 
                                         
      After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that: 
                                         
      A.     RESPONDENT 
 
             1.     Maiher, age 41, was KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.’s (“KBCM”) 
Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) from April 2007 through November 2011 and Series 27 
Financial and Operations Principal (“FinOp”) from April 2007 through December 2011.  
KBCM terminated Maiher’s employment in May 2012.  Maiher was primarily responsible 
for maintaining KBCM’s financial records.  He submitted KBCM’s Annual Audited 
Report to the Commission and oversaw the filing of its monthly Financial and Operational 
Combined Uniform Single Reports (“FOCUS Reports”) with FINRA, which then furnished 
the FOCUS Reports to the Commission.  Pursuant to internal policies and procedures that 
were applicable to KBCM, Maiher was required to certify after the close of each month 
that KBCM’s general ledger balance sheet information had been compared with, and 
---------------------Page 2---------------------

reconciled to, the underlying back-office system information.  Maiher is currently an 
assistant controller for a wholly owned banking subsidiary of a publicly traded company. 
 
       B.     RELEVANT ENTITY 
 
              2.     KBCM is a broker-dealer registered with the Commission and is a 
subsidiary of KeyCorp, a financial services company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio.  
 
       C.     KBCM’S BOOKS AND RECORDS WERE INACCURATE 
 
              3.      Beginning at some point prior to January 2011, and through January 
2012, Maiher, who was KBCM’s CFO (until November 2011) and FinOp, directed that 
unsubstantiated or “plug” entries be made to one or more accounts in KBCM’s general 
ledger, in order to complete KBCM’s monthly close-the-books process.  The amount of the 
plug entries varied over time.     
        
              4.      The plug entries resulted in KBCM overstating its assets and income 
in its fiscal year 2010 financial statements, which were included in its fiscal year 2010 
Annual Audited Report filed with the Commission in February 2011.  Maiher signed this 
report, affirming that the accompanying financial statements were “true and correct.” 
        
              5.     The plug entries to the general ledger also resulted in inaccurate 
financial information being included in KBCM’s monthly FOCUS Reports that Maiher 
caused to be filed with FINRA, which then furnished the FOCUS Reports to the 
Commission, for some point prior to January 2011 through January 2012.  In 2012, 
KBCM filed amended FOCUS Reports.   
        
              6.     In its Annual Audited Report for the year ended December 31, 2011, 
KBCM disclosed that its prior period financial statements (for fiscal year 2010) included 
unsubstantiated assets of $13,679,000 ($8,591,000 net of taxes) and omitted liabilities of 
$4,305,000 ($2,701,000 net of taxes).  Specifically, the 2011 Annual Audited Report stated 
“[t]he December 31, 2010, Statement of Financial Condition included $13,679[,000] in net 
trade date receivables that was found to be unsubstantiated during 2011.”  KBCM’s write-
off of the unsubstantiated assets and accrual of the unrecorded liabilities resulted in restated 
net income of $3,136,000, a 78% reduction versus the previously reported $14,428,000, 
and restated shareholder’s equity of $316,796,000, an $11,292,000 reduction, from the 
previously reported $328,088,000.

       D.     RESPONDENT DIRECTED THAT PLUG ENTRIES BE MADE TO 
              KBCM’S GENERAL LEDGER 
        
                                                                1
              7.     KeyCorp’s written policies and procedures  that were applicable to 
KBCM required KBCM’s finance department, led by Maiher, to reconcile certain general 
ledger accounts to the back office securities trading and inventory software system.  The 
general ledger system was referred to as MSA.  MSA was the source of the official books 
and records of KBCM.  The back office system for KBCM was referred to as Broadridge.   
               
              8.     The purpose of reconciling accounts was to ensure that the 
information in MSA was accurate.  Generally, reconciliation is an accounting process used 
to compare two sets of records to ensure the figures are in agreement.  During the relevant 
period, KeyCorp’s Reconcilement Process & Account Certification Procedure stated that 
the goal of reconciliation was “to verify that the balance and activity in the [general ledger] 
account agrees with the expected balance and activity as recorded elsewhere.”  This 
document further explained that “[w]hen external reports are published to our shareholders 
and government agencies, it is critical that the general ledger system from which those 
reports are prepared be correct.” 
               
              9.     The applicable policies and procedures required accounts to be 
reconciled on a periodic basis, which was generally daily or weekly “unless the account has 
very low transaction volume.”  At a minimum, all accounts were to be reconciled monthly. 
        
              10.    Among the accounts that Maiher and his team were required to 
reconcile were the firm’s inventory accounts.  According to a KBCM Inventory 
Accounting Process Narrative, “KBCM buys, sells, and maintains inventory positions in 
federal, municipal, and corporate bonds and stocks in order to make markets, earn trading 
profits, or act as a wholesaler.  KBCM makes markets for approximately 200 
(OTC/NASDAQ) stocks.”  Despite the fact that the inventory accounts did not have “very 
low transaction volume,” they were reconciled only monthly.  
        
              11.    The applicable policies and procedures required Maiher to segregate 
the duties of preparing, reviewing, and certifying the inventory accounts reconciliations.  
Accordingly, one of KBCM’s accountants was responsible for preparing the 
reconciliations, KBCM’s Controller was responsible for reviewing the reconciliations, and 
Maiher was responsible for certifying them.  Specifically, Maiher was responsible for 
timely certifying the inventory accounts in KeyCorp’s On-Line Certification System.     
        
              12.    As explained in KeyCorp’s policies and procedures, Maiher’s 
certification of a general ledger account was a formal attestation that: properly documented 
controls and procedures were in place; reconciliations were routinely performed according 
to an established schedule; the reconciliation for the account was current; and the 

                                                 
1
 The policies and procedures include “Policy ACC-403: KeyCorp Reconciliation and 
Certification Policy” and “Procedure AR-5001: Reconcilement Process & Account 
Certification.” 

                                            3 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

supporting sub-system, which is Broadridge in this instance, was in agreement with the 
general ledger.    

               13.    Further, as stated in the policies and procedures, by certifying an 
account, Maiher was making himself “personally accountable for the integrity of the 
account” and stating that “a formal reconciliation, with all pertinent documentation, has 
been prepared and reviewed, and that all reconciling items have been adequately 
documented.”   
        
               14.    As part of KBCM’s reconciliation process, any difference between 
related account balances in MSA and Broadridge needed to be identified and was 
considered a reconciling item.  Reconciling items needed to be researched and resolved 
within established time limits.  The inventory accounts were subject to a 30-day aging 
period, after which any unresolved differences between MSA and Broadridge were to be 
written off consistent with KeyCorp policy.  The approval needed to charge off an item 
depended on the dollar amount.  Maiher’s write-off authority was capped at $100,000 per 
KeyCorp policy.  Stale items in excess of $100,000 were only to be written off with the 
approval of KeyCorp’s Chief Accounting Officer, CFO or Corporate Controller. 
        
               15.    If a reconciling item was deemed a “reportable exception,” it needed 
to be recorded in the on-line certification system.  A “reportable exception” was defined as 
a reconciling item “deemed significant enough to alert senior management to a potential 
problem which may indicate a breakdown of internal controls or present the possibility of 
significant loss.”  Variances between MSA and Broadridge of $10,000 or more, which had 
not cleared through the normal transaction life cycle, fell into this category. 

               16.    It was Maiher’s responsibility, as certifier of the inventory accounts, 
to describe any reportable exception in clear language, explain the efforts being made to 
correct the exception, and provide the anticipated date of resolution.  Maiher had until the 
20th of each month to timely certify the prior-month inventory account balances and 
document any reportable exceptions in the on-line certification system.  Certifications 
submitted after the 20th were considered late.  A monthly report summarizing the results of 
the certification program, including any reported exceptions, was provided to senior 
finance management of KeyCorp.  As explained in the policies and procedures, “[t]his 
[exception reporting] afford[ed] senior management reasonable assurance that appropriate 
internal controls are in place and that problems are identified and resolved in a timely 
manner.” 
                
               17.    Beginning at some point prior to 2011, and through January 2012, 
Maiher directed that “plug” entries be made to the general ledger in order to balance and be 
able to close the books on a monthly basis.   

               18.    During 2010, 2011, and January 2012, as part of the monthly close-
the-books process, at Maiher’s direction, the staff accountant populated the reconciliation 
spreadsheet for the inventory accounts.  The initial iteration of this spreadsheet showed the 
variances between the general ledger and Broadridge.  At Maiher’s direction, the staff 
accountant also prepared a corresponding “correcting entry” spreadsheet that, in more 

                                             4 
---------------------Page 5---------------------

summary fashion, compared the month-end MSA long and short inventory balances with 
the long and short inventory trade date balances in Broadridge.  The “correcting entry” 
spreadsheet was a tool that served as the basis for a series of manual adjusting entries that 
were then made to the general ledger to make the general ledger match Broadridge.  These 
adjusting entries were described as “Trade Date Long” or “Trade Date Short” and were 
made to the 129186 “Trading Inv-Other” and 273500 “Liab for Shrt Positions” accounts.  
The number of such adjusting entries, as well as the dollar amounts, varied by month.  In 
2011, there were typically 10 or more such adjusting entries made during the monthly 
close.  After these entries were posted to the general ledger, the staff accountant updated 
the reconciliation spreadsheet; certain variances that appeared on the pre-close version of 
the spreadsheet were thus absent from the final version that was signed by Maiher as 
certifier, post-close. 

              19.    The securities inventory reconciliation and the related “correcting 
entry” spreadsheet also computed manual adjustments that were made each month to 
general ledger accounts 196727 “Trade Date Receivable” and 299220 “Trade Date 
Payable.”  Maiher directed these adjustments, in combination with the manual adjustments 
to accounts 129186 and 273500, to be made in order to purportedly reflect the MSA 
inventory account balances on a trade date basis for regulatory reporting purposes.  An 
interface or graph between Broadridge and MSA automatically computed the firm’s trade 
date receivable and payable data on a daily basis.  In approximately April 2011, Maiher had 
the interface turned off so that the trade date receivable and payable data was no longer 
being automatically fed into MSA and had to be computed manually. 

              20.    If all of the month-end adjusting entries did not result in MSA 
balancing, the staff accountant, at Maiher’s direction, would include an additional adjusting 
entry to plug the unexplained difference in order to be able to close the books in the firm’s 
internal system.  In most instances, Maiher directed that this plug entry be described as a 
“Trade Date Adjustment.”  All of the manual adjusting entries were typically made on 
either day 1 or day 2 after the month-end and the books were closed on day 3.   

              21.    For February, July, August, September, November, and December, 
Maiher directed that the additional plug entry, without which the books would not balance, 
be made to the “Trade Date Receivable” account.  For March and October, Maiher directed 
that this additional adjusting entry be made to the “Trading Inv–Other” account.  For 
January, April, May, and June, Maiher directed that this additional adjusting entry be made 
to an income statement account.  Below are the additional adjusting entries that were made 
to balance and close the books monthly for December 2010 through December 2011:

              22.     Although the purpose of the KBCM inventory reconciliation process 
was to identify, research and timely resolve any differences between corresponding account 
balances in MSA and the Broadridge subsystem, through the process undertaken by Maiher 
and his staff, differences were routinely eliminated through the expedient of adjusting 
entries made during the monthly close, after which the inventory account balances were 
certified by Maiher as reconciled.  For example, for February, March, April and June 2011, 
Maiher certified the inventory accounts without an exception of any kind.  For other 
months, he certified with exception(s) but did not disclose that there was an unexplained 
variance.  Rather, he gave assurances the variance was or would be properly resolved.  
Maiher also repeatedly failed to certify the inventory accounts or report exceptions within 
the time period required by KeyCorp policy. 
               
              23.    By coming up with the process by which the reconciler determined 
the adjusting entries, directing that they be made to the general ledger, and then certifying 
the inventory account reconciliations, Maiher also failed to ensure appropriate segregation 
of duties, in violation of the applicable policies and procedures. 
        
              24.    KBCM hired a new CFO in November 2011.  After he was hired, 
the new CFO discovered the variances after reviewing the most recent reconciliations and 
notified KBCM’s and KeyCorp’s management.  Maiher did not begin to report that there 
was a potential unexplained variance until late in 2011, after the new CFO had been hired, 
and even then he was not transparent about the plug entries he had directed be made to 
balance the firm’s books. 
               
              25.    Maiher was subsequently terminated from KBCM in May 2012.  In 
the Form U5 termination notice that KBCM filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority, KBCM explained that Maiher was terminated for “involvement in inaccurate 
entries in the firm’s general ledger, failure to ensure substantiating documentation relating 
to those entries and failure to ensure appropriate segregation of duties.”   
               
              26.    Through the conduct described above, Maiher caused 
unsubstantiated entries to be made in the records of KBCM; caused the records of KBCM 
to be inaccurate; and caused false FOCUS Reports and financial statements to be filed with 
FINRA, which then furnished the FOCUS Reports to the Commission. 
 
       E.     VIOLATIONS 
 
              27.    Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act requires registered broker-
dealers to make and keep records, and to make and disseminate reports prescribed by 
Commission rule.  The requirements to make and keep required records includes the 

                                            6 
---------------------Page 7---------------------

requirement that such records be accurate.  Rule 17a-3(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires, 
among other things, that every broker-dealer make and keep current ledgers reflecting all 
assets and liabilities relating to the firm’s business.  As a result of the conduct described 
above, KBCM violated Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3(a)(2) thereunder 
because its general ledger did not accurately reflect all of the firm’s assets and liabilities.  
Section 17(e) of the Exchange Act requires registered broker-dealers to annually file with 
the Commission a balance sheet and income statement certified by a public accounting 
firm.  Rule 17a-5(a) requires periodic FOCUS Reports.  Rule 17a-5(d) requires registered 
broker-dealers to file with the Commission annual audited reports.  KBCM violated 
Section 17(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-5(a) and 17a-5(d) thereunder by 
including unsubstantiated assets in its monthly FOCUS Reports filed with FINRA, which 
then furnished the FOCUS Reports to the Commission, prior to 2011 through January 
2012, among other months, and in its fiscal year 2010 Annual Audited Report. 
 
               28.    Respondent Maiher willfully aided and abetted and caused KBCM’s 
violations of Sections 17(a) and 17(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3(a)(2), 17a-5(a), 
and 17a-5(d) thereunder. 
 
                                            III. 
        
       In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission 
deems it necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative and 
cease-and-desist proceedings be instituted to determine: 
        
       A.      Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in 
connection therewith, to afford Maiher an opportunity to establish any defenses to such 
allegations;  
        
       B.      What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against 
Maiher pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act including, but not limited to, civil 
penalties pursuant to Section 21B of the Exchange Act;  
        
       C.      What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against 
Maiher pursuant to Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1) of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice; and 
        
       D.      Whether, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Maiher should be 
ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of and any future 
violations of Section 17 of the Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3 and 17a-5 thereunder, 
whether Maiher should be ordered to pay a civil penalty pursuant to Section 21B(a) of the 
Exchange Act. 
        
                                            IV. 
        
       IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the 
questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened not earlier than 30 days and not 

                                             7 
---------------------Page 8---------------------

later than 60 days from service of this Order at a time and place to be fixed, and before an 
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the 
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.
