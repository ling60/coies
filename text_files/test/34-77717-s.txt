ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING 
File No. 3-17227 
 
SEC Announces Settlement with Cabelas and its CFO for        Misleading Statements in 
Commission Filings and Earnings Releases 
 
April 26, 2016  The Securities and Exchange Commission today  announced that outdoor 
recreation retailer <comp.>Cabelas Incorporated</> and its chief financial officer agreed to settle charges 
that investors were misled by a key financial metric highlighted in Cabelas Commission filings 
and earnings releases to explain the companys profitability.   
 
Specifically, the Commission found that  Cabelas calculation of the metric it called merchandise 
gross margin percentage erroneously  included promotional fees received each quarter from its 
wholly-owned bank subsidiary that issues the Cabelas CLUB Visa Card.  Generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) require s companies to eliminate such intercompany payments in 
preparing their consolidated financial statements.  Cabelas failure to eliminate the promotional 
fees in consolidation resulted in an understatement of the companys merchandise <item.>costs</> and an 
inflated merchandise <item.>gross margin</> percentage touted to investors in periodic filings and quarterly 
earnings releases in <date.>2012</>.  Cabelas periodic filings incorrectly stated, All intercompany 
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Cabelas did not disclose the 
material impact of the promotions fee on the metric in its description of the reasons for the year-
over-year increase in merchandise gross margin percentage.  Because of the error in 
consolidation and the lack of disclosure, investors were not aware that an intercompany payment 
was responsible for a material part of the improvement in the key financial metric.  
 
Cabelas agreed to pay a $1 million penalty.  CFO Ralph W. Castner agreed to pay a $50,000 
penalty to settle charges that he caused the failure to disclose the material positive impact of the 
intercompany payment.   
 
According to the SECs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, Cabelas also failed 
to account properly for several other items as required under GAAP in its financial statements 
for the third quarter of 2012, increasing its quarterly net income by nearly 5 percent. 
The SECs order finds that Cabelas violated the reporting, books and records, and internal 
accounting controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Castner caused 
Cabelas violations related to the intercompany payment.  Cabelas and Castner neither admit nor 
deny the findings. 
The SECs investigation was conducted by Patricia E. Foley, Daniel M. Konosky, and Mary S. 
Brady.  The case was supervised by Thomas J. Krysa and litigation assistance was provided by 
Gregory Kasper.
